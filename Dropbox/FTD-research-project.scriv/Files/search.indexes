            <Text>Purpose of the experiment.
Experimental design – number of animals, the age and sex tested.
Data about each animal (Local ID, date of birth, strain, sex and centre)
Procedure – the protocol, which can also be called the standard operating procedure, followed.
Data QC – here information is presented on why a data point could be excluded. For example in the calorimetry screen the respiratory exchange ratio has to be between 0.7-1 as this reflects what Pheno
Parameters – the measured variables. Those that are marked as positive for “annotation” indicate variables of interest which will be processed through a statistical analysis pipeline.
Metadata – parameters that the area experts have determined as important for capture that could explain potential variation in the parameters of interest (e.g. equipment model). Those that are indicated as “required for analysis” are parameters that are used in data assembly for comparison 

IMPC Phenotyping Definitions
Pipeline
A collection of Procedures (experiments) that need to be done to the mice in a defined sequence.
Procedure
A procedure is an experiment that is done during a certain week and in the way defined in the Protocol (see Protocol).
Protocol
The definition of how a Procedure (experiment) should be carried out as well as what parameters should be measured.
QC
Quality Control is an important part of ensuring that data submitted to the DCC is valid. There is an automated processing pipeline and a manual pipeline where data will be statistically analyzed and verified by Data Wranglers.

Parameter
A parameter is a measurement obtained during an experiment. Also see Parameter Type. Most parameters are measured parameters e.g. Body Weight. Some Parameters are Derived (see Derived Parameter) and some are Metadata (see Metadata Parameter). A Parameter's value needs to be of a certain data type like FLOAT (floating point number like 30.6) for Body Weight, and they can also have a unit, e.g. g (grams), if necessary. A parameter can be optional or required for upload (see Req. Upload). Optional parameters do not need to be submitted when sending data to the DCC but it is recommended to capture them. A parameter can have enumerated values submitted for it if it has Options (see Option). A parameter can also have multiple values submitted for it if is an Increment parameter (see Increment). Media such as images or video can also be submitted as part of the data submission if the Media tick is present (see Media).
Increment
If a parameter requires multiple readings to be obtained then it is Incremental. There are two types of increments measured in IMPReSS - simple repeats and defined increments. A simple repeat is taken any number of times but a minimum number of readings need to be obtained for the data to be accepted. Defined increments are measurements that must be taken at specific intervals such as t=0, t=15, t=30, t=45, t=60 seconds.
Parameter Type
The type of a parameter is either Measured (a measurement/observation), Derived (requiring other measured parameters to calculate its value) or Metadata (data providing information about experimental conditions or the equipment used). Metadata is used to ensure that comparison across different datasets is consistent across equipment, experimental conditions and the environment the experiment was conducted in. The formula used to calculate a derived parameter is shown on IMPReSS. 
Parameter Data Type
The data type of a parameter in IMPReSS can be any one of TEXT, INT, FLOAT, BOOL, IMAGE or DATETIME. The parameter data type will aid in the valid comparison of data and the automated validation of submitted data so if we expect a floating point number and we are given a boolean then the Data Wranglers can notified about the error and investigate it.
Mandatory Procedure
If a Procedure is marked as Mandatory then it must be submitted to the DCC. If it is not marked as Mandatory then it is optional. Optional procedures are not required to be submitted but it is recommended to submit them.
Media
A Parameter that has Media ticked means that an image or video clip can be submitted with the data.
Metadata Parameter
A Metadata parameter is not for collecting experimental values but for collecting information about the conditions the experiment was done under or about the equipment used. Equipment Manufacturer, Experimenter ID and Period Of falting are examples of Metadata Parameters.
Option
If the results of an experiment or observation can be defined into an enumerated set of values then these can be submitted as Option values. e.g. Yes/No.</Text>

            <Title>Data analysis</Title>
            <Text>OpenStats package provides statistical methods for the identification of abnormal phenotypes with an emphasis on high-throughput dataflows. The package contains:
Dataset pre-processing and checking for minimal requirements; and
3 statistical tests to identify significant genotype effect on the phenotype:
Fisher’s exact test for categorical data
Linear mixed model (LMM) for continuous data
Reference range plus (RR+) model for low N continuous data
All analysis frameworks output a statistical significance measure, an effect size measure, model diagnostics (when appropriate), and data visualization (particularly chart pages).
Categorical data
Categorical data are analysed using Fisher’s exact test. This method involves constructing a contingency table to split animals up by phenotype and biological group, e.g. mutant versus baseline. Currently, phenotypes for a given trait are grouped together and compared to the frequency of normal phenotypes collectively. Examples of this type of analysis include abnormal coat colour and abnormal eye morphology.
Independent variable (AKA factor): The variable that the experimenter manipulates; it does not depend on other variables being measured. Often displayed on the x-axis.
Dependent variable: The variable that is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable. Often displayed on the y-axis, so that changes in X, the independent variable, effect changes in Y.
Continuous data
Linear mixed model
Continuous data are analysed using a linear mixed model. This method uses a linear equation to model measurements as a function of genotype and additional variables including gender, weight, and batch (date of measurement). The batch is treated as a random effect except in the case of measurements that are taken over time (e.g. body weight), in which case it is included in the covariates. Interactions between variables such as genotype and sex can also be modelled.
This approach allows the statistical procedure to determine significant shifts that can be attributed to the genotype as opposed to the other covariates. Examples of this type of analysis include hypoactivity in open field and circulating insulin levels in clinical chemistry.
Control selection strategy
One side effect of producing data in a high throughput pipeline is that the input data for a statistical calculation might be produced over multiple days. Environmental fluctuations have been identified as a confounding factor when comparing data gathered on different days. The IMPC describes this as a “batch effect” and it is treated as a random effect in the Mixed model framework.

Mice and rats used in the laboratory derive from a variety of sources. Production of inbred strains means that these backgrounds can be defined and thus require nomenclature conventions. It should be borne in mind that genetic drift means that there may still be unknown genetic differences between individuals within strains.{ | Faskowitz, et al., 2020 | | |zu:7172713:PSPCRX5H}{ | Di, &amp; Biswal, and Alzheimer's Disease Neu, 2012 | | |zu:7172713:6N6V7FT8}{ | Dunlop, 1994 | | |zu:7172713:594EHUG6}{ | Feng, et al., 1996 | | |zu:7172713:HZNSTJ2E}{ | Fay, et al., 1998 | | |zu:7172713:WBUWFY3W}{ | DeJesus-Hernandez, et al., 2011 | | |zu:7172713:YX65KB2Q}{ | Dickinson, et al., 2016 | | |zu:7172713:G6TT8Q8R}
Mice
Most laboratory mice have contributions from both Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus. There is evidence that smaller contributions also may have come from Mus musculus molossinus and Mus musculus castaneus. Therefore, they should not be referred to by species name, but rather as laboratory mice or by use of a specific strain or stock name. (In addition, some recently developed laboratory mouse strains are derived wholly from other Mus species or other subspecies, such as M. spretus). Nostros inline anotamonosss
Mouse strain names should be registered through the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) at http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/submissions/amsp_submission.cgi.

I don’t think so


Rats
Laboratory rat strains derive from the Rattus norvegicus species. Another species, Rattus rattus, also is used as an experimental model, but has not contributed to the common laboratory rat strains.
Rat strain names should be registered through the Rat Genome Database (RGD) at http://rgd.mcw.edu/tools/strains/strainRegistrationIndex.cgi.</Text>

The Scrivener-like way to do this would be to break your manuscript into sub-documents matching the outline structure, so that you don't have headings in the text at all 

First off, I've organised my binder as follows: Chapter as folders, Sections as documents, Sub-Sections as sub-documents. I use the &lt;$hn&gt; code in front of each section for automatic numebring 

I copy and paste only the automatically generated bibliography to the chapter-draft.rtf in order to avoid losing the inline citation syntax for further iterations of the revision process: I've instructed my supervisor to trust that the { brackets will be replaced by the ( ones in the camera ready version of the file, yet he still has access to the full references list should he want to check some. (I use a similar trick for table and figures refs: I tweak the code $$n:figure:uniqueimagename&gt; instead of &lt;$n:figure:uniqueimagename&gt; to run a simple Find&amp;Replace $$n to &lt;$n when I'm pretty sure the numbering will not change. Or you can handle this in Word in the camera ready version). 
See manual scriv 3: Part II, Ch. 8 
Combining Links with Placeholders
	Scrivener comes packed with many useful placeholder tags that can be typed into your work and substituted for dynamic information when you compile. A simple example of this is the &lt;$modifiedDate&gt; placeholder, which prints the modification date of the binder item you type it into.3
	An interesting capability you have at your disposal is combining these placeholders with document links. When selecting a placeholder in its entirety and linking to another document with it, the metadata will be extracted from the link target rather than the item you typed the placeholder into. From our previous example, if you select the &lt;$modifiedDate&gt; placeholder and link it to another document, the modification date for the target will print in this section.
	You may style or format the placeholder in the manner you would like to see the ﬁnal text formatted. Since placeholders (with the notable exception of the
&lt;$include&gt; placeholder (subsection 10.1.5)) are all plain text they will always use the formatting context they are included within.
Copying whole contents is one use, but the tag can be used to insert smaller elements into longer texts. This can be useful for common snippets, ﬁgures and tables kept in separate ﬁles, and so forth.
Creating Textual Links
There are several approaches to using the &lt;$include&gt; placeholder, each with their own distinct advantages:
Specify the binder name of the item you wish to include in the placeholder itself: &lt;$include:nameOfItem&gt;. This method is direct and simple, which may be reason enough to use it. There are some advantages with more advanced usage:
When using this placeholder from within compile settings them- selves, you will need to use this method.
A downside to be aware of is that you might end up including an un- intended document, if there are more than one items in the binder with the name you typed in.
In part to answer the latter limitation, applying a link to the placeholder is a more speciﬁc way of designating a binder item:
Type the &lt;$include&gt; placeholder into the document where you wish to have the mirrored or cloned text printed.
Select the placeholder in its entirety and use the document link fea- ture to point it at the item you wish to have imported into this spot.
The third possibility is to supply a ﬁle system path into the placeholder, which will insert material from plain-text (txt) or rich text (rtf) ﬁles on your disk.  This is a very simple process that will not insert images, foot- notes or comments.
Paths can be absolute, meaning the full system path to the ﬁle is supplied:
&lt;$include:D:\Snippets\filename.rtf&gt;
Paths can also be made relative to the project’s location on the disk. This example would refer to a ﬁle in the same folder as the project:
&lt;$include:filename.rtf&gt;
If you are working cross-platform, and wish to compile from both PC and Mac, consider using Replacements to convert your path structure according to which system you are using.
How Included Text Formatting Works
Since included text can represent formatted information, styles and formatting will be determined based on usage:
The included text will always use its character styling—even if that means “no style”.
Included text brings along its paragraph styling if the placeholder is on a line of its own. A block quote will remain a block quote when inserted.
The paragraph style will be omitted if the included text is inline within an- other paragraph. It will however still bring in its own character formatting or styles.
Naturally, text coming in from .txt ﬁles will use whatever formatting con- text they are inserted into.
The Section Type of the source document will be ignored. The inserted text will be treated according to the type of document it is inserted into.
An exception to the above is when placeholders are used from the compile Format settings. In this case the original document’s formatting will be used, including any compile settings that may be applicable to the original item’s Section Type.</Notes>

#
Opposite Strand Genes
Transcripts from the opposite strand that overlap another gene, or a transcript that is derived principally from the introns of another gene, or one that uses an alternative reading frame to another gene (and does not use the existing frame to a significant extent) should be given a different name.
Other genes on the opposite strand should be assigned the symbol of the known gene with the suffix &quot;os&quot; for opposite strand.
Example:
Zbtb8os  zinc finger and BTB domain containing 8, opposite strand
Gene Families
Identified by Hybridization
Identified by Sequence Comparison
ESTs
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs): ESTs that clearly derive from a known gene should be considered simply as an assay (marker) for that known gene 
 Anonymous DNA Segments
Mapped DNA Segments:

DNA segment, Chr 1, Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch, NIAMS
D4Mit17
DNA segment, Chr 4, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 17 (a simple sequence length polymorphism within the mouse Orm1 gene)
Mouse or rat DNA segments that are detected by cross-hybridization to human segments are given the human name with &quot;chromosome N, cross-hybridizing to human DNA segment&quot; inserted between DNA segment and the human segment code (see symbols). The same applies for rat DNA segments detected by cross-hybridization to mouse segments (or vice versa).
D16H21S13

Rat DNA segment on Chr 1 that cross-hybridizes with a DNA segment D7Mit236 from mouse Chr 7
Gene Trap Loci
Gene trap experiments in embryonic stem (ES) cells produce cell lines in which integration into a putative gene is selected by virtue of its expression in ES cells. The trapped gene is usually (though not necessarily) mutated by the integration. The site of integration can be characterized by a number of means, including cloning or extension of cDNA products. The loci of integration of a series of gene trap lines, once characterized as potentially unique, can be named and symbolized as members of a series, using the prefix Gt (for gene trap), followed by a vector designation in parentheses, a serial number assigned by the laboratory characterizing the locus, and the laboratory ILAR code. 
For example, the 26th gene &quot;trapped&quot; by the ROSA vector in the laboratory of Phillip Soriano (Sor) is symbolized as:
Gt(ROSA)26Sor
Quantitative Trait Loci, Resistance Genes, and Immune Response Genes
Differences between inbred strains and the phenotype of offspring of crosses between strains provide evidence for the existence of genes affecting disease resistance, immune response, and many other quantitative traits (quantitative trait loci, QTL)

Chromosomal Rearrangements
Symbols for chromosomal deletions, inversions, and translocations are given in the Rules for Nomenclature of Chromosome Aberrations. The end points of each of these rearrangements, however, define a locus. Where there is only a single locus on a chromosome, the chromosome anomaly symbol serves to define it. However, where an anomaly gives two loci on a single chromosome they can bedistinguished by the letters p and d for proximal and distal.
For example, In(1)1Rk-p, In(1)1Rk-d are the proximal and distal end points of the chromosomal inversion In(1)1Rk in mouse.
Genes Residing on the Mitochondria
The mitochondria carry essential genes, among them many transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Genes residing on the mitochondria have a prefix mt- (lowercase mt followed by a hyphen). For transfer RNAs, the symbols consist of three parts, mt-, T (for tRNA), and a single lowercase letter for the amino acid. The chromosomal designation for mitochondrial genes is Chr MT.
Examples:
mt-Tc
tRNA, cysteine, mitochondrial(a tRNA gene residing on the mitochondria)
mt-Atp6  
ATP synthase 6, mitochondrial(a non-tRNA gene residing on the mitochondria)

RNA Housekeeping Genes Encoded in the Nucleus
There are hundreds of loci encoding transfer RNAs (tRNA) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), and many are encoded in the nucleus. The following method symbolizes these nuclear-encoded RNA genes:
Naming nuclear encoded transfer-RNAs
Symbols for nuclear encoded transfer-RNAs consist of four parts:

n-
lowercase n followed by a hyphen to indicate nuclear encoding
T
uppercase T to indicate transfer-RNA
A
the single letter abbreviation for the amino acid (uppercase)
xxx
the 3-letter anticodon (lowercase)
#
serial number (only when needed to distinguish multiple copies of a particular anticodon tRNA class

n-TAagc12
nuclear encoded tRNA alanine 12 (anticodon AGC)

Naming nuclear encoded ribosomal-RNAs
Symbols for nuclear encoded ribosomal-RNAs consist of four parts:

n-
lowercase n followed by a hyphen to indicate nuclear encoding
R
uppercase R to indicate ribosomal-RNA
subunit
the subunit designation
#
serial number for this ribosomal-RNA

n-R5s104
nuclear encoded rRNA 5S 104

microRNAs and microRNA clusters
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundant, short RNA molecules that are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences on target mRNA transcripts, usually resulting in translational repression or target degradation and gene silencing.
Naming microRNAsSymbols for microRNAs consist of the root symbol Mir followed by the numbering scheme tracked in the miRBase database (www.mirbase.org), a database tracking microRNAs reported for all species. (c.f. Desvignes, et al., 2015)
For example, mouse Mir143 (microRNA 143) is represented as mmu-mir-143 in miRBase, with the mmu signifying mouse.
Naming microRNA clustersA microRNA cluster consists of several microRNAs in immediate genome proximity. These may be given symbols and names to refer unambiguously to the entire cluster.
For a microRNA cluster, the name will consist of the root symbol Mirc (for microRNA cluster) followed by a serial number (1, 2, 3…) for the cluster. MGI (for mouse) or RGD (for rat) should be consulted for the next available cluster number when a new cluster is defined. The list of microRNAs included in each cluster will be recorded in relevant database records for the genes, knockouts, and strains.
(Note that this differs from the definition of miRBase, which simply refers to clustered miRNAs as those less than 10kb from the miRNA of interest. Thus, in miRBase clusters defined based on one miRNA may or may not overlap clusters based on another miRNA.
Long noncoding RNAs
Long non-coding RNAs (long ncRNAs, lncRNAs) are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into protein. The conservation of long ncRNAs is assessed on a case by case basis.
Lincmd1 for long intergenic non-protein coding RNA of muscle differentiation 1
Xist for X inactive specific transcript
Enhancers, Promoters, and Regulatory Regions
Enhancers, promoters, and regulatory regions can influence multiple genes. In addition, they can be localized far away from the gene(s) that they affect. Thus, it is misleading to name them based on the gene for which regulation was first recognized.
Enhancers, promoters, and regulatory regions are to be symbolized as:

Rr#
regulatory region #
where # indicates the next number in the series


Names and Symbols for Variant and Mutant Alleles
Different alleles of a gene or locus can be distinguished by a number of methods, including DNA fragment length, protein electrophoretic mobility, sequence comparison, or variant physiological or morphological phenotype.
All mutant alleles, whether of spontaneous or induced origin, targeted mutations, gene traps, or transgenics should be submitted to MGD (mouse) or RGD (rat) for an allele or gene accession identifier.
3.1   Mutant Phenotypes
3.1.1   Genes Known Only by Mutant Phenotypes
Where a gene is known only by mutant phenotype, the gene is given the name and symbol of the first identified mutant. Symbols of mutations conferring a recessive phenotype begin with a lowercase letter; symbols for dominant or semidominant phenotype genes begin with an uppercase letter.
Examples:
In mouse, recessive spotting, rs; abnormal feet and tail, Aft; circling, cir

Further (allelic) mutations at the same locus, if they have the same phenotype, are given the same name with a Laboratory code preceded by a serial number (if more than one additional allele from the same lab). In the symbol the Laboratory code is added as a superscript.
Example:
tp2J   the second new allele of the taupe gene identified at The Jackson Laboratory

If a new allelic mutation of a gene known only by a mutant phenotype is caused by a transgenic insertion, the symbol of this mutation should use the symbol of the transgene as superscript (see Section 3.4.2 and Section 4).
Example:
awgTg(GBtslenv)832Pkw  
this mutation of abnormal wobbly gait is caused by a transgene in mouse line 832, produced in the laboratory of Paul Wong. (An abbreviated form, awgTg832Pkw can be used if the abbreviated designation is unique.)

If the additional allele has a different phenotype, it may be given a different name, but when symbolized the new mutant symbol is superscripted to the original mutant symbol. Also, if a new mutation is described and named but not shown to be an allele of an existing gene until later, the original name of the new mutation can be kept. Even if the phenotype is apparently identical, the original symbol is used, with the new mutation symbol as superscript.
Example:
grey coat is an allele of recessive spotting (rs) in the mouse, and hence is symbolized rsgrc

3.1.2   Phenotypes Due to Mutations in Structural Genes
When a spontaneous or induced mutant phenotype is subsequently found to be a mutation in a structural gene, or the gene in which the mutation has occurred is cloned, the mutation becomes an allele of that gene and the symbol for the mutant allele is formed by adding the original mutant symbol as a superscript to the new gene symbol. (The mutant symbol should retain its initial upper or lowercase letter).
The hotfoot (ho) mutation of the mouse glutamate receptor Grid2, Grid2ho
The dominant white spotting (W) mutation of mouse Kit, KitW
If the original mutation has multiple alleles, when describing these alleles, their symbols become part of the superscript to the identified structural gene.
creeper, Grid2ho-cpr.
viable white spotting, KitW-v; sash, KitW-sh.
Even if the identified gene is novel and unnamed, it is recommended that it is nevertheless given a name and symbol different from the mutant name and symbol. This will more readily allow discrimination between mutant and wild type and between gene and phenotype.
3.1.3   Wild Type Alleles and Revertants
The wild type allele of a gene is indicated by + as superscript to the mutant symbol.
The wild type allele of the taupe mutation, tp+
The wild type Kit locus (if necessary to distinguish from mutations), Kit+
A revertant to wild type of a mutant phenotype locus should be indicated by the symbol + with the mutant symbol as superscript.
Revertant to wild type at the hairless mutant locus +hr
Additional revertants are given a Laboratory Code and preceded by a serial number if more than one revertant is found in a lab. Serial numbers are independent for mouse and rat revertants and no homology is implied. If the revertant is in a gene that has been cloned, then the mutant symbol is retained as superscript to the gene symbol, and + is appended.
Revertant to wild type of the dilute mutation of myosin Va; Myo5ad+
Second such revertant identified at The Jackson Laboratory; Myo5ad+2J
Engineered reversions of phenotypic mutations should be indicated by the gene symbol and superscripted mutant symbol followed by the + symbol and appropriate engineered allele designation. The format then is
Genemutation+tm#LabcodeExample:
Crb1rd8+em1Mvw   reversion to wild-type of the Crb1rd8 mutation by endonuclease mediated targeting, 1st reported from the laboratory of Michael Wiles.

3.2   Variants
3.2.1   Biochemical Variants
Electrophoretic or other biochemicalvariant alleles of known structural genes are usually given lowercase letters to indicate different alleles, and in the symbol the letter becomes a superscript to the gene symbol.
Example:
glucose phosphate isomerase 1 alleles a and b; Gpi1a, Gpi1b

3.2.2   DNA Segment Variants
Variants of DNA segments are indicated by a superscript to the symbol. The symbol is usually an abbreviation for the inbred strain in which the variant is being described. However, a particular allele may be found in several inbred strains, and, furthermore, it may be difficult to establish whether an allele in one strain is identical to one in another. The use of allele symbols for DNA segments is mainly limited to describing inheritance and haplotypes in crosses. As long as the symbols are defined in the description, users are free to use whatever allele symbol best fits their needs. In tables of genotypes, the gene symbol can be omitted and the allele abbreviation used alone.
D11Mit19a, D11Mit19b, D11Mit19c are variant alleles of D11Mit19 in mouse.
3.2.3   Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
Polymorphisms defined by SNPs may occur within or outside of a protein coding sequence.
If the SNP occurs within a gene, the SNP allele can be designated based on its dbSNP_ID, followed by a hyphen and the specific nucleotide.
Examples:
Park2rs6200232-G  
The Park2 rs6200232 SNP allele with the G variant
Park2rs6200232-A
The Park2 rs6200232 SNP allele with the A variant

If the SNP occurs outside of an identified gene, the SNP locus can be designated using the dbSNP_ID as the locus symbol and the nucleotide allelic variants are then superscripted as alleles. If a gene is later discovered to include this SNP locus, the same guidelines are applicable as those used when mutant locus symbols become alleles of known genes.
Examples:
rs6200616T  
A SNP locus with the T variant
rs6200616C
A SNP locus with the C variant

Note: If a gene Xyz is later discovered to include this SNP locus, rs620061, then the alleles listed above become Xyzrs620061-T and Xyzrs620061-C.
3.3  Variation in Quantitative Trait Loci and in Response and Resistance Genes
Variation in genes that do not give rise to a visible phenotype may be detected by assaying physiological or pathological parameters. Examples of this type of variation include levels of metabolite, immune response to antigen challenge, viral resistance, or response to drugs. Genetic variation may also produce phenotypic variation in morphology, behavior, or other observable traits that interact in a complex manner with other genes and/or with the environment.
These genes can only be identified by virtue of allelic variation. In most cases, there will not be a clear wild type; hence all alleles should be named. In most cases, the alleles should be named according to their strain of origin and symbolized by adding the strain abbreviation as superscript, although for resistance and sensitivity, variants r and s may be used. Bear in mind that resistance alleles deriving from different strains may not be the same and should be given different names and symbols.
Once the gene underlying a quantitative trait has been cloned or identified, the phenotypic name should be replaced by the name of the identified gene. The allele names and symbols should be the same as those used for the phenotype.
Examples:
Slc11a1r
solute carrier family 11, host resistance allele
Slc11a1s
solute carrier family 11, host susceptibility allele(the QTL originally known as BCG/Lsh resistance has been identified as Slc11a1)
Scc2BALB/cHeA  
colon tumor susceptibility 2, BALB/cHeA allele
Scc2STS/A
colon tumor susceptibility 2, STS/A allele(for QTL Scc2, the STS/A allele has increased tumor susceptibility vs. BALB/cHeA)

3.4   Insertional and Induced Mutations
Mutations that are induced, targeted, or selected in structural genes are named as alleles of the structural gene.
3.4.1   Mutations of Structural Genes
Variants of structural genes that are clearly mutations, whether or not they confer a phenotype, are given the superscript m#Labcode, where # is a serial number and is followed by the Laboratory code where the mutation was found or characterized. Serial numbers are independently assigned in mouse and rat and the same assigned serial number does not imply orthology. If the mutation is known to have occurred on a particular allele, that can be specified by preceding the superscript with the allele symbol and a hyphen.
for example, Mod1a-m1Lws is a mutation of the mouse Mod1a allele, the first found in the laboratory of Susan Lewis.
If the mutation is shown to be a deletion of all or part of the structural gene, the superscript del can be used in place of m. Note that this should be used only for deletions that encompass a single gene; larger deletions should use the chromosomal deletion nomenclature.
3.4.2    Transgenic Insertional Mutations
Mutations produced by random insertion of a transgene (not by gene targeting) are named as a mutant allele of the gene (which should be given a name and symbol if it is a novel gene), with the superscript the symbol for the transgene (see Section 3.1.1 for examples, and Section 4 for naming transgenes).
3.5    Targeted and Trapped Mutations
3.5.1   Knock-out, Knock-in, Conditional and Other Targeted Mutations
Mutations that are the result of gene targeting in ES cells are given the symbol of the targeted gene, with a superscript consisting of three parts: the symbol tm to denote a targeted mutation, a serial number from the laboratory of origin and the Laboratory code where the mutation was produced (see Section 2.1).
Example:
Cftrtm1Unc is the first targeted mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (Cftr) gene produced at the University of North Carolina.

Targeted mutations that result in the ablation of any gene expression (i.e., functionally null) are termed knock-out mutations.
Targeted mutations, in which a foreign gene or gene segment is inserted into a target gene, resulting in expression of the foreign gene under control of the endogenous promoter are termed knock-in mutations. In these cases, the foreign (replacing) gene symbol is used parenthetically as part of the targeted allele symbol. Reporter symbols, however, are not indicated in allele symbols. Details describing specific of knock-in constructs should be associated in databases or publications, and not in nomenclature.
Examples:
En1tm1(Otx2)Wrst   
in this targeted knock-in mutation, the coding region of En1 was replaced by the Otx2 gene, originating from the W. Wurst laboratory.
Cd19tm1(cre)Cgn  
in this targeted knock-in mutation, cre was inserted in-frame in exon 1. The allele expresses cre recombinase specifically in B-lineage cells throughout development.
Apoetm1(APOE*2)Mae  
in this targeted knock-in mutation, a DNA fragment containing exons 2-4 of a human APOE2 isoform replaced the equivalent portion of the mouse Apoe gene. The human protein is expressed from this allele and the endogenous mouse protein is undetectable.

Knock-in alleles expressing RNAi under the control of the endogenous promoter can be designated using targeted mutation or transgene mutation nomenclature, as appropriate:
Example:
Genetm#(RNAi:Xyz)Labcode

When a targeting vector is used to generate multiple germline transmissible alleles, such as in the Cre-Lox system, the original knock-in of loxP would follow the regular tm designation rules. If a second heritable allele was then generated after mating with a cre transgenic mouse, it would retain the parental designation followed by a decimal point and serial number.
Example:
Tfamtm1Lrsn and Tfamtm1.1Lrsn. In this example, Tfamtm1Lrsn designates a targeted mutation where loxP was inserted into the Tfam gene. Tfamtm1.1Lrsn designates another germline transmissible allele generated after mating with a cre transgenic mouse. Note: somatic events generated in offspring from a Tfamtm1Lrsn bearing mouse and a cre transgenic that cause disruption of Tfam in selective tissues would not be assigned nomenclature.

Other more complex forms of gene replacement, such as partial &quot;knock-in&quot;, hit-and-run, double replacements, and loxP mediated integrations are not conveniently abbreviated and should be given a conventional tm#Labcode superscript. Details of the targeted locus should be given in associated publications and database entries.
Note that although subtle alterations made in a gene appear to lend themselves to a simple naming convention whereby the base or amino acid changes are specified, in fact these do not provide unique gene names, as such alterations, which could be made in independent labs, while bearing the same changes, may differ elsewhere in the gene.
For MHC complex engineered alleles, include the haplotype of the allele symbol, similar to spontaneous mutations.
Examples:
H2-Kb-tm1Bpe
targeted mutation allele on 129P2/OlaHsd b haplotype
H2-Db-tm1Bpe
targeted mutation allele on 129P2/OlaHsd b haplotype
H2-Ab1g7-em1Ygch
CRISPR generated alllele on NOD g7 haplotype

Large-scale projects that systematically produce a large number of alleles (&gt;1000) may include a project abbreviation in parentheses as part of the allele designation. These should retain the accepted nomenclature features of other alleles of that class. For example, a targeted allele created by Velocigene (Regeneron) in the KOMP knockout project:
Gstm3tm1(KOMP)Vlcg
Once fully designated in a publication, the allele can be abbreviated by removing the portion of the allele designation in parentheses (in this case, Gstm3tm1Vlcg), provided the symbol remains unique.
Additional details for naming mutations and visualizing allele structures for targeted mutations generated from the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) are provided separately. See IKMC mutation nomenclature and IKMC allele structure.
3.5.2   Endonuclease-mediated Mutations
Endonuclease-mediated mutations are targeted mutations generated in pluripotent or totipotent cells by an endonuclease joined to sequence-specific DNA binding domains. The mutation is introduced during homology-directed or non-homologous end-joining repair of the induced DNA break(s). Technologies generating these types of mutations include TALENs, CRISPR, Cas9, etc. (c.f. Gaj, et al., 2013; Wijshake, et al., 2014)
Endonuclease-mediated mutations are given the symbol of the mutated gene, with a superscript consisting of three parts: the symbol &quot;em&quot; to denote an endonuclease-mediated mutation, a serial number from the laboratory of origin and the ILAR registered laboratory code of the laboratory where the mutation was produced.
Example:
Fgf1em1Mcw
the first endonuclease-induced mutation of the fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgf1) gene produced at the Medical College of Wisconsin

Knock-ins, conditional and derivative alleles may be named similarly to targeted mutations above.
Examples:
Ptpn6em1.1Shoy
the first derivative of the first endonuclease-induced mutation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 6 gene produced by Sho Yamasaki
Gt(ROSA)26Sorem1.1(CAG-cas9*,-EGFP)Rsky
the first derivative of the first endonuclease-induced mutation of the gene trap ROSA 26 gene produced by Klaus Rajewsky

3.5.3    Gene Trap Mutations
Gene trap mutations are symbolized in a similar way to targeted mutations. If the trapped gene is known, the symbol for the trapped allele will be similar to a targeted mutation of the same gene using the format Gt(vector content)#Labcode for the allele designation.
Example:

Akap12Gt(ble-lacZ)15Brr
a gene trap allele of the Akap12 gene, where the gene trap vector contains a phleomycin resistance gene (ble) and lacZ, the 15th analyzed in the laboratory of Jacqueline Barra (Brr)

If the trapped gene is novel, it should be given a name and a symbol, which includes the letters Gt for &quot;gene trap,&quot; the vector in parentheses, a serial number, and Laboratory code.
For example, a gene trapped locus (where the gene is unknown) using vector ROSA, the 26th made in P. Soriano's laboratory, is Gt(ROSA)26Sor.
For high throughput systematic gene trap pipelines, the mutant ES cell line's designation can be used in parentheses instead of the vector designation, and the serial number following the parentheses may be omitted.
Examples:
Gt(DTM030)Byg
for a trapped gene (at an undefined locus) in mutant ES cell line DTM030, made by BayGenomics
Osbpl1aGt(OST48536)Lex  
gene trap allele of the oxysterol binding protein-like 1A gene, in mutant ES cell line OST48536, made by Lexicon Genetics, Inc.

3.5.4    Enhancer Traps
Enhancer traps are specialized transgenes. One utility of these transgenes is in creating cre driver lines. Enhancer traps of this type that are currently being created may include a minimal promoter, introns, a cre recombinase cassette (sometimes fused with another element such as ERT2), and polyA sites from different sources.
Nomenclature for these enhancer traps consists of 4 parts as follows:
Et
prefix for enhancer trap
cre recombinase cassette
portion in parentheses...for example, cre, icre, or cre/ERT2 (if fused with ERT2)
line number or serial number
to designate lab trap number or serial number
Lab code
ILAR code identifying the creator of this enhancer trap

Examples:
Et(icre)1642Rdav
Enhancer trap 1642, Ron Davis
Et(cre/ERT2)2047Rdav
Enhancer trap 2047, Ron Davis

Note that the minimal promoter, poly A source, etc. are not part of the enhancer trap nomenclature. These are molecular details of the specific construct that will be captured in database records and reported with experimental results.
4   Transgenes
Any DNA that has been stably introduced into the germline of mice or rats is a transgene. Transgenes can be broken down into two categories:
Those that are produced by homologous recombination as targeted events at particular loci
Those that occur by random insertion into the genome (usually by means of microinjection)
Nomenclature for targeted genes is dealt with in Section 3.5. Random insertion of a transgene in or near an endogenous gene may produce a new allele of this gene. This new allele should be named as described in Section 3.4.2. The transgene itself is a new genetic entity for which a name may be required. This section describes the guidelines for naming the inserted transgene.
4.1   Symbols for transgenes
It is recognized that it is not necessary, or even desirable, to name all transgenes. For example, if a number of transgenic lines are described in a publication but not all are subsequently maintained or archived, then only those that are maintained require standardized names. The following Guidelines were developed by an interspecies committee sponsored by ILAR in 1992 and modified by the Nomenclature Committee in 1999 and 2000. Transgenic symbols should be submitted to MGD or RGD through the nomenclature submission form for new loci. The transgene symbol is made up of four parts:
Tg denoting transgene
In parentheses, the official gene symbol of the inserted DNA, using nomenclature conventions of the species of origin
The laboratory's line or founder designation or a serial number (note that numbering is independent for mouse and rat series)
The Laboratory code of the originating lab
No part of a transgene symbol is ever italicized as these are random insertions of foreign DNA material and are not part of the native genome.
Examples:
Tg(Zfp38)D1Htz
a transgene containing the mouse Zfp38 gene, in line D1 reported by Nathaniel Heintz.
Tg(CD8)1Jwg
a transgene containing the human CD8 gene, the first transgenic line using this construct described by the lab of Jon W. Gordon.
Tg(HLA-B*2705, B2M)33-3Trg  
a double transgene in rat containing the human HLA-B*2705 and B2M genes, that were co-injected, giving rise to line 33-3 by Joel D. Taurog.

The *, as used in the last example above, indicates that the included gene is mutant.
Different transgenic constructs containing the same gene should not be differentiated in the symbol; they will use the same gene symbol in parentheses and will be distinguished by the serial number/Laboratory code. Information about the nature of the transgenic entity should be given in associated publications and database entries.
In many cases, a large number of transgenic lines are made from the same gene construct and only differ by tissue specificity of expression. The most common of these are transgenes that use reporter constructs or recombinases (e.g., GFP, lacZ, cre), where the promoter should be specified as the first part of the gene insertion designation, separated by a hyphen from the reporter or recombinase designation. The SV40 large T antigen is another example. The use of promoter designations is helpful in such cases.
Examples:
Tg(Wnt1-LacZ)206Amc  
the LacZ transgene with a Wnt1 promoter, from mouse line 206 in the laboratory of Andrew McMahon
Tg(Zp3-cre)3Mrt
the cre transgene with a Zp3 promoter, the third transgenic mouse line from the laboratory of Gail Martin

In the case of a fusion gene insert, where roughly equal parts of two genes compose the construct, a forward slash separates the two genes in parentheses.
Example:
Tg(TCF3/HLF)1Mlc  
a transgene in which the human transcription factor 3 gene and the hepatic leukemia factor gene were inserted as a fusion chimeric cDNA, the first transgenic mouse line produced by Michael L. Cleary's laboratory (Mlc).

This scheme is to name the transgene entity only. The mouse or rat strain on which the transgene is maintained should be named separately as in the Rules and Guidelines for Nomenclature of Mouse and Rat Strains. In describing a transgenic mouse or rat strain, the strain name should precede the transgene designation.
Examples:
C57BL/6J-Tg(CD8)1Jwg
mouse strain C57BL/6J carrying the Tg(CD8)1Jwg transgene.
F344/CrlBR-Tg(HLA-B*2705, B2M)33-3Trg  
rat strain F344/CrlBR carrying the Tg(HLA-B*2705,B2M)33-3Trg double transgene

For BAC transgenics, the insert designation is the BAC clone and follows the same naming convention as the Clone Registry at NCBI.
Example:
Tg(RP22-412K21)15Som  
a BAC transgene where the inserted BAC is from the RP22 BAC library, plate 412, row K, column 21. It is the 15th in the mouse made in the laboratory of Stefan Somlo (Som).

Transgenes containing RNAi constructs can be designated minimally as:

Tg(RNAi:geneX)#Labcode, where
geneX
is the gene that is knocked down
#
is the serial number of the transgene

An expanded version of this designation is:

Tg(Pro-yyRNAi:geneX)#Labcode, where
Pro-
can be used optionally to designate the promoter
yy
can be used optionally for the specific RNAi construct

While there is the option to include significant information on vectors, promoters, etc. within the parentheses of a transgene symbol, this should be minimized for brevity and clarity. The function of a symbol is to provide a unique designation to a gene, locus, or mutation. The fine molecular detail of these loci and mutations should reside in databases such as MGD and RGD.
4.2  Intergenic sites used as &quot;neutral&quot; recipient sequence landing sites
Commonly used insertion sites include Gt(Rosa)26Sor and Hprt. The characteristics of these loci are such that they are &quot;benign&quot; in not affecting expression or function of other genes. New sites that are intergenic are being identified that can also serve as neutral insertion sites for transgenesis and are designated by Igs# (Intergenic site #), where # indicates a serial number.
These intergenic genomic sequences can be modified by targeted, spontaneous or other means of mutagenesis to facilitate the creation of alleles for modified intergenic sites such as those generated by MICER targeting or knock-out alleles for highly conserved sequences that reside within intergenic sequences. In general, these sites are benign, not affecting expression or function of other genes, but can act as a generic site for many kinds of inserted DNA. These markers differ from Regulatory Region markers in that Igs# loci do not exhibit regulator function.
Intergenic sites are to be symbolized as:
Igs#   Intergenic site # where # indicates the next number in the series.5    Transposon-induced Mutations and Inserts
Three types of genetic inserts are involved in creating transposon-induced mutations. Two lines, one carrying the transposable-element as a concatamer and the other carrying the transposase are mated. This causes the transposable-element to come in contact with the transposase and to be mobilized from its original site, and, when reintegrated into the genome, can cause a heritable phenotypic mutation. (c.f., Ding, et al.,2005; Bestor, 2005; Dupuy, et al., 2005). Accepted nomenclature for the transposable-element inserts, transposase transgenes, and resulting transposed insertion alleles are given below.
5.1   Transgenic Transposable Element (TE) Concatamers
The transgenic transposable element concatamers are identified with a standard prefix Tg (for transgenic) and Tn (for transposable element). The class of transposable element may be included in parentheses. The general format of the symbol is:
TgTn(transposon_class_abbreviation-vector)#LabcodeExample:  TgTn(sb-T2/GT2/tTA)1DlaThe symbol consists of:
Tg denoting transgenic
Tn denoting transposon
In parentheses, a lowercase abbreviation of the transposon class (in this case sb for Sleeping Beauty), followed by a hyphen and the vector designation
The laboratory's line or founder designation or a serial number
The Laboratory Code of the originating lab
5.2  Transposase Inserts
Transposases can be engineered into the genome via transgenesis or specific gene targeting. In these cases the relevant nomenclature for transgenes or targeted mutations is used.
For a transgene, use the standard prefix Tg (for transgene). The contents of the parentheses will usually be the promoter and the symbol for the transposase with which it is associated, separated by a hyphen. The general format of the symbol is:
Tg(promoter-transposase)#LabcodeExample:  Tg(ACTB-sb10)545AbcThe symbol consists of:
Tg denoting transgene
In parentheses, the official gene symbol for the promoter, using the nomenclature of the species of origin, followed by a hyphen and a lowercase transposase symbol, in this case sb10 for the Sleeping Beauty 10 transposase
The laboratory's line or founder designation or a serial number
The Laboratory code of the originating lab
For a targeted knock-in of the transposase, use the standard format for a targeted mutation, i.e., the symbol of the targeted gene with a superscripted allele symbol beginning with the prefix tm. The contents of the parentheses will usually be the symbol for the transposase with which it is associated. The general format of the symbol is:
Genetm#(transposase)LabcodeExample:  Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(sb11)Njen
The symbol consists of:
The gene into which the transposase was integrated, in this case Gt(ROSA)26Sor
In the superscript:
tm denoting targeted mutation
A serial number of the targeted mutation
In parentheses, a lowercase transposase symbol, in this case sb11 for the Sleeping Beauty 11 transposase
The Laboratory Code of the originating lab
5.3   Transposed Insertion Alleles
These alleles follow the rules for naming all other alleles. In general a transposable element concatamer marker will already be established, as above. The new allele, then, will be a superscripted form of the concatamer symbol. Note that all such alleles that are &quot;derived from&quot; a transposable element concatamer carry the original number with a decimal point and serial number identifying the specific allele. The general format is:
GeneTn(transposon_class_abbreviation-vector)#LabcodeExample: Car12Tn(sb-T2/GT2/tTA)1.1DlaThe symbol consists of:
The gene into which the transposable element was integrated (transposed)
In the superscript:
Tn denoting transposon
In parentheses, a lowercase abbreviation of the transposon class (in this case sb for Sleeping Beauty), followed by a hyphen and the vector designation
A serial number, in which the primary number corresponds to that given to the transposable element concatamer from which it arose, followed by a decimal point and a serial number designating its number within the series of derivative insertion alleles.
The Laboratory Code of the lab originating the transposable element line
If a newly transposed insertion occurs in an unknown site or intergenic region, the form:
Tn(transposon_class_abbreviation-vector)#Labcode
is used to symbolize the &quot;genomic mutation&quot; without being superscripted to a gene symbol, similar to the way a random transgene inserted into a non-gene site is designated.
6   Definitions
The following definitions should aid the user in understanding what is being named, and in understanding the principles underlying these guidelines.
6.1   Gene
A gene is a functional unit, usually encoding a protein or RNA, whose inheritance can be followed experimentally. Inheritance is usually assayed in genetic crosses, but identification of the gene in cytogenetic or physical maps are other means of mapping the locus of a gene. The existence of a gene can also be inferred in the absence of any genetic or physical map information, such as from a cDNA sequence.
6.2   Pseudogene
A sequence that closely resembles a known functional gene, at another locus within a genome, that is non-functional as a consequence of (usually several) mutations that prevent either its transcription or translation (or both). In general, pseudogenes result from either reverse transcription of a transcript of their &quot;normal&quot; paralog (in which case the pseudogene typically lacks introns and includes a poly(A) tail; often called processed pseudogenes) or from recombination (in which case the pseudogene is typically a tandem duplication of its &quot;normal&quot; paralog). Note that in mouse and rat, a gene may be a pseudogene in one inbred strain but not another.
6.3   Locus
A locus is a point in the genome, identified by a marker, which can be mapped by some means. It does not necessarily correspond to a gene; it could, for example, be an anonymous non-coding DNA segment or a cytogenetic feature. A single gene may have several loci within it (each defined by different markers) and these markers may be separated in genetic or physical mapping experiments. In such cases, it is useful to define these different loci, but normally the gene name should be used to designate the gene itself, as this usually will convey the most information.
6.4   Marker
A marker is the means by which a gene or a locus is identified. The marker is dependent on an assay, which could, for example, be identification of a mutant phenotype or presence of an enzyme activity, protein band, or DNA fragment. The assay must show genetic variation of the marker to map the locus on a genetic map but not to place it on a physical map.
6.5   Allele
The two copies of an autosomal gene or locus on the maternal and paternal chromosomes are alleles. If the two alleles are identical, the animal is homozygous at that locus. When genetically inherited variants of a gene or locus are detectable by any means, the different alleles enable genetic mapping. A single chromosome can only carry a single allele and, except in cases of duplication, deletion or trisomy, an animal carries two autosomal alleles. In particular, a transgene inserted randomly in the genome is not an allele of the endogenous locus; the condition is termed hemizygous if the transgene is present only in one of the two parental chromosome sets. By contrast, a gene modified by targeting at the endogenous locus is an allele and should be named as such.
6.6   Allelic Variant
Allelic variants are differences between alleles, detectable by any assay. For example, differences in anonymous DNA sequences can be detected as simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Other types of variants include differences in protein molecular weight or charge, differences in enzyme activity, or differences in single-stranded conformation (SSCP). Many allelic variants, in particular DNA variants, do not confer any external phenotype on the animal. These variants are often termed “polymorphisms” although, strictly speaking, that term applies only to variants with a frequency of more than 1% in the population.
6.7   Splice Variant or Alternative Splice
Alternative splicing of a gene results in different, normally occurring forms of mRNA defined by which exons (or parts of exons) are used. Thus one or more alternative protein products can be produced by a single allele of a gene. Among different alleles, alternative splice forms may or may not differ, depending on whether the sequence difference between the alleles affects the normal splicing mechanism and results in differences in the exon (or partial exon) usage. For example, allele A may produce mRNAs of splice form 1, 2, and 3; while allele B may produce mRNAs of splice form 1, 2, and 4; and Allele C may produce mRNAs of splice form 1, 2, and 3. In this case, each of the alleles A, B, and C by definition must differ in their DNA sequence. However, the difference between allele B versus alleles A and C must include a sequence difference that affects the splicing pattern of the gene.
6.8    Mutation
A mutation is a particular class of variant allele that usually confers a phenotypically identifiable difference to a reference &quot;wild type&quot; phenotype. However, in some cases, such as when homologous recombination is used to target a gene, a readily identified phenotype may not result even though the gene may be rendered non-functional. In such cases, the targeted genes are nevertheless referred to as mutant alleles.
6.9    Dominant and Recessive
Dominant and recessive refer to the nature of inheritance of phenotypes, not to genes, alleles, or mutations. A recessive phenotype is one that is only detected when both alleles have a particular variant or mutation. A dominant phenotype is detectable when only one variant allele is present. If both alleles can be simultaneously detected by an assay, then they are codominant. For example, an assay that detects variation of DNA or protein will almost invariably detect codominant inheritance, as both alleles are detected. If a mutation produces a phenotype in the heterozygote that is intermediate between the homozygous normal and mutant, the phenotype is referred to as semidominant. A single mutation may confer both a dominant and a recessive phenotype. For example, the mouse patch (Ph) mutation has a heterozygous (dominant) pigmentation phenotype but also a homozygous (recessive) lethal phenotype. As the terms are applied to phenotypes not to genes or alleles, then in the case where a gene has multiple mutant alleles, each can confer a phenotype that is dominant to some, but recessive to other, phenotypes due to other alleles.
Penetrance is a quantitative measure of how often the phenotype occurs in a population; and expressivity is a measure of how strongly a phenotype is expressed in an individual. Particularly in segregating crosses, or where there is a threshold effect on phenotypic manifestation, these measures provide additional ways to describe how particular allelic combinations result in a phenotype.
6.10   Genotype
Genotype is the description of the genetic composition of the animals, usually in terms of particular alleles at particular loci. It may refer to single genes or loci or to many. Genotype can only be determined by assaying phenotype, including test mating to reveal carriers of recessive mutations. Strictly speaking, even direct determination of DNA variants is assaying phenotype not genotype as it is dependent on a particular assay, although it is so close to genotype that it serves as a surrogate.
6.11   Phenotype
Phenotype is the result of interaction between genotype and the environment and can be determined by any assay.
6.12   Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs)
Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) are polymorphic loci that contain alleles, which differentially affect the expression of continuously distributed phenotypic traits. Usually these are markers described by statistical association to quantitative variation in the particular phenotypic traits that are controlled by the cumulative action of alleles at multiple loci.
6.13   Haplotype
A haplotype is the association of genetically linked alleles, as found in a gamete. They may be a combination of any type of markers, and may extend over large, genetically separable distances, or be within a short distance such as within a gene and not normally separated.
6.14   Homolog
Genes are homologous if they recognizably have evolved from a common ancestor. Note that genes are either homologous or not; there are no degrees of homology! For example, all globin genes, and myoglobin, are homologs, even though some are more closely related to each other than others. When a measure of relatedness between sequences is required, percent identity or similarity should be used.
6.15   Ortholog
Genes in different species are orthologs if they have evolved from a single common ancestral gene. For example, the beta globin genes of mouse, rat and human are orthologs. Note that several genes in the mouse or rat may have a single ortholog in another species and vice versa.
6.16   Paralog
Paralogous genes are genes within the same species that have arisen from a common ancestor by duplication and subsequent divergence. For example, the mouse alpha globin and beta globin genes are paralogs.
NAMING CHORMOSSOMES
1.   General Guidelines for Designating Chromosomes
Mouse chromosomes are numbered and identified according to the system given by Nesbitt and Francke (1973), Sawyer et al. (1987), Beechey and Evans (1996), and Evans (1996). The word Chromosome should start with a capital letter when referring to a specific chromosome and may be abbreviated to Chr after the first use, e.g., Chromosome (Chr) 1 and Chr 1. The X and Y chromosomes are indicated by capital letters rather than numbers.
Cytogenetic bands are named by capital letters, alphabetically designating the major Giemsa (G)-staining bands from centromere to telomere. Major subdivisions within cytogenetic bands are numbered. Additional subdivisions are designated using a decimal system.
Examples:
Major G-band designation:
Chr 17B
Major subdivisions within the Chr 17B band:
17B1, 17B2
Additional subdivision of band 17B1:
17B1.1, 17B1.2, 17B1.3, etc.

2.   Symbols for Chromosome Anomalies
Chromosome anomaly symbols are not italicized (unlike gene symbols).
Symbols for chromosome anomalies consist of three parts:
A prefix defining the type of anomaly
Specifically formatted information indicating the chromosomes involved
A series number and Laboratory code designation that uniquely identifies the anomaly
2.1    Prefix
A chromosome anomaly designation begins with a prefix that denotes the type of anomaly. Each prefix begins with a capital letter, with any subsequent letters being lowercase. The accepted prefixes are:

Cen
Centromere
Del
Deletion
Df
Deficiency
Dp
Duplication
Hc
Pericentric heterochromatin
Hsr
Homogeneous staining region
In
Inversion
Is

Iso
Isochromosome
MatDf
Maternal deficiency
MatDi
Maternal disomy
MatDp  
Maternal duplication
Ms
Monosomy
Ns
Nullisomy
PatDf
Paternal deficiency
PatDi
Paternal disomy
PatDp
Paternal duplication
Rb
Robertsonian translocation
T

Tp
Transposition
Ts
Trisomy
UpDf
Uniparental deficiency
UpDi
Uniparental disomy
UpDp
Uniparental duplication

2.2    Designating the chromosomes involved in an anomaly
The chromosome(s) involved in the anomaly should be indicated by adding the appropriate Arabic numerals or letters in parentheses, between the anomaly prefix and the series symbol.
If two chromosomes are involved in a chromosome anomaly, such as translocations and insertions, the chromosomes are separated by a semicolon. In the case of Robertsonian translocations, the chromosomes involved are separated by a period indicating the centromere.
In the case of insertions, the chromosome donating the inserted portion should be given first, followed by the recipient chromosome.
2.3   A series number and Laboratory code designation that uniquely identifies the anomaly
The first and each successive anomaly from a particular laboratory or institution is distinguished by a series symbol, consisting of a serial number followed by the Laboratory Registration Code or Laboratory code of the person or laboratory who discovered the anomaly. Each type of chromosomal anomaly from a given laboratory will have its own series of serial numbers (see examples). The Laboratory code should be the code already assigned for the particular institute, laboratory, or investigator for use with strains that they hold. If there is no preassigned code, one should be obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) ( http://dels.nas.edu/global/ilar/lab-codes). Laboratory codes are uniquely assigned to institutes or investigators and are usually three to four letters (first letter uppercase, followed by all lowercase).
Examples:
Del(9)4H
deletion involving Chr 9, the 4th deletion from Harwell
In(15)4H
inversion involving Chr 15, the 4th inversion from Harwell
Is(13;1)4H
insertion of part of Chr 13 into Chr 1; the 4th insertion from Harwell
In(5)2Rk
inversion involving Chr 5; the 2nd inversion from T.H. Roderick's lab
Rb(3.15)2Rk  
Robertsonian translocation involving Chr 3 and Chr 15, the 2nd Robertsonian translocation from T.H. Roderick's lab.
Iso(6)1H
isochromosome 6, the 1st isochromosome from Harwell

Note: As mouse chromosomes are all acrocentric, with the exception of Chr Y, the p and q arm designations standard for human chromosomes are not used. For mouse Chr Y, p and q are appended as required. Example: Iso(Yq).
2.4    Abbreviating chromosome anomalies
Once the full designation for a chromosome anomaly is written in a document, an abbreviation can be used thereafter. The abbreviation consists of the anomaly prefix plus the serial number designation and Laboratory code. The chromosomal content in parentheses is omitted.
Using the examples from section 2.3:

Full designation   
Abbreviation
Del(9)4H
Del4H
In(5)2Rk
In2Rk
Is(13;1)4H
Is4H
Rb(3.15)2Rk
Rb2Rk

2.5    Symbols for multiple chromosome anomalies
When an animal carries two or more anomalies that are potentially separable by recombination, the symbols for both (or all) anomalies should be given.
Examples:
Rb(16.17)7Bnr T(1;17)190Ca/+ +   an animal heterozygous for a Robertsonian and a reciprocal translocation, each involving Chr 17. The anomalies are organizationally in &quot;coupling&quot; i.e., the same Chr 17 is involved in both.
Rb(5.15)3Bnr +/+ In(5)9Rkan animal heterozygous for a Robertsonian and heterozygous for an inversion. Because they share a common chromosome, Chr 5, the organization of the anomalies is specified as in &quot;repulsion.&quot;
Rb(10.11)5Rma/+ T(3;4)5Rkan animal that is heterozygous for a Robertsonian translocation and homozygous for an unrelated reciprocal translocation.
2.6    Symbols for complex chromosome anomalies
When one chromosome anomaly is contained within another or is inseparable from it, the symbols should be combined.
Example:
T(In1;5)44H  an animal carrying a translocation between Chrs 1 and 5 in which the Chr 1 segment is inverted.
2.7    Designating chromosomal breakpoints
The symbols p and q are used to denote the short and long arms, respectively, of mouse chromosomes. In translocations, breaks in the short arm should be designated with a p, but the q for long arm may be omitted if the meaning is clear. Because mouse autosomes and the X Chromosome are acrocentric, they do not have a short arm other than a telomere proximal to the centromere. Therefore, most rearrangements in mouse chromosomes involve breaks in the long arm (q arm). In mouse, Chr Y has both a p and q arm.
Example:
T(Yp;5)21Lubtranslocation involving a break in the short arm of the Y Chromosome and the long arm of Chr 5; the 21st from Lubeck.
2.7.1     Defining the chromosomal band
When the positions of the chromosomal breakpoints relative to the G-banded karyotype are known, these are indicated by adding the band numbers, as given in the standard karyotype of the mouse (Evans 1996), after the appropriate chromosome numbers.
T(2H1;8A4)26Hreciprocal translocation having breakpoints in band H1 of Chr 2 and band A4 of Chr 8; the 26th from Harwell
In(XA1;XE)1Hinversion of the region between the breakpoints in bands A1 and E of the X Chromosome; the 1st from Harwell
Del(7E1)Tyr8Rldeletion of band 7E1 manifesting as a mutation to albino, Tyrc;the 8th from Russell
Is(In7F1-7C;XF1)1Ct  inverted insertion of a segment of Chr 7 band F1-C into the X Chromosome at band F1; the 1st from Cattanach
For pericentric inversions the symbols pq and/or appropriate band numbers should be used.
In(8pq)1Rlpericentric inversion involving Chr 8; the 1st from Russell
In(8pqA2)pericentric inversion of the region between the short arm and band A2 of the long arm of Chr 8
In(5C2;15E1)Rb3Bnr 1Ctthe first inversion found by Cattanach in Rb3Bnr of the region between bands 5C2 and 15E1
2.8    Deficiencies and deletions as chromosomal anomalies
The deficiency (Df) and duplication (Dp) nomenclature should be restricted in its use to defining the unbalanced products of chromosome aberrations, i.e., deficient/duplicated chromosomes resulting from malsegregation of reciprocal translocations. Deletions are interstitial losses often, although not always, cytologically visible. Neither of these terms should be applied to small intragenic deletions. The latter give rise to allelic variation in a single locus and are given allele symbols.
2.9    Imprinting and chromosomal anomalies
Since the 1980s, mouse translocations have been extensively used in imprinting studies to generate uniparental disomies and uniparental duplications (partial disomies) and deficiencies of whole or selected chromosome regions, respectively (reviewed by Cattanach and Beechey 1997 and Beechey 1999). The resulting chromosomal change may be of maternal, paternal, or uniparental (referring to one or the other parent without specification of maternal vs. paternal) origin.
These chromosome anomalies are of three types:
Disomy - two copies of a chromosome derived from one parent
Duplications - two copies of a chromosome region derived from one parent
Deficiencies - missing segments of a particular chromosome region originating from one parent
Disomies and duplications of one parental copy imply deficiency of the other parental copy.
The nomenclature for these anomalies includes the affected chromosome in parentheses. The abbreviations, prox (proximal) and dist (distal) can be used to denote the position of the duplication/deficiency relative to the breakpoint of a translocation used to generate the duplication/deficiency. Similarly, if a translocation is used to produce a uniparental disomy or duplication, this can be indicated in the symbol.
MatDi(12)maternal disomy for Chr 12
PatDp(10)paternal duplication for a region of Chr 10
MatDp(dist2)maternal duplication for distal Chr 2
MatDf(7)maternal deficiency for Chr 7
PatDi(11)Rb4Bnrpaternal disomy for Chr 11 produced using Robertsonian translocation Rb(11.13)4Bnr
MatDp(dist2)T26Hmaternal duplication for the region of Chr 2 distal to the breakpoint of the reciprocal translocation T(2;8)26H
2.10    Deletions identified through phenotypic change
If cytologically visible deletions are first detected by change in the phenotype produced by a gene (e.g., MgfSl-12H), the gene and allele symbol designation should be included in the chromosome anomaly symbol, e.g,. Del(10)MgfSl-12H1H was originally identified as Sl12H (see Rules for Nomenclature of Genes, Genetic Markers, Alleles, and Mutations in Mouse and Rat).
2.11    Chromosomal aneuploidy
Trisomies and monosomies should be denoted by the appropriate prefix symbol, followed by the chromosome(s) concerned. If a tertiary aneuploid or partial aneuploid is derived from a translocation, then the chromosome composition (proximal chromosome end; superscripted distal chromosome end) is denoted in parentheses, followed by the serial number and Laboratory code.
Ts16trisomy for Chr 16
Ts(113)70H  trisomy for the proximal end of Chr 1 and the distal end of Chr 13, derived from the translocation T(1;13)70H (also referred to as tertiary trisomy or partial trisomy).
Nullisomy, monosomy, and tetrasomy are denoted similarly.
2.12    Transchromosomal anomalies
Transchromosomal is the term used to reference the case where a chromosome, chromosomal fragment, or engineered chromosome from another species exists as a separate, heritable, freely segregating entity or is centromerically fused to an endogenous chromosome. The designation of the additional chromosome is represented parenthetically including the species abbreviation and chromosome from that species, followed by an established line number and an ILAR Laboratory code.
The format for a transchromosomal is:   Tc(AAAbb)CCXxx
Where
Tc =  transchromosomal
AAA =  species abbreviation (e.g., HSA=human; MUS=mouse; BOV=bovine)
Bb =  chromosome number of the inserted fragment from the other species
CC =  line number
Xxx =  Laboratory code
Tc(HSA21)91-1Emcftranschromosomal, human 21, line 91-1 Elizabeth M. C. FisherThis is an engineered mouse line containing a fragment of human chromosome 21 as a freely segregating heritable fragment.
3.    Variations in Heterochromatin and Chromosome Banding
3.1    Nucleolus organizers
The symbol NOR should be reserved for nucleolus organizers. Different organizers should be distinguished by chromosome numbers. Polymorphic loci within the ribosomal DNA region are designated with the root gene symbol, Rnr and the chromosome number (see Rules and Nomenclature of Genes, Genetic Markers, Alleles, and Mutations in Mouse and Rat).
Example:
Rnr12a polymorphic DNA segment that identifies the ribosomal DNA region on Chr 12
3.2    Pericentric heterochromatin
The symbol H should be used for heterochromatin visualized cytologically, followed by a symbol indicating the chromosome region involved, in this case c for centromeric, and a number indicating the chromosome on which it lies.
Example:
Hc14
pericentric heterochromatin on Chr 14
Variations in size, etc., of any block should be indicated by superscripts, using n for normal or standard, l for large and s for small bands.
Example:
Hc14n
normal or standard pericentric heterochromatin on Chr 14.In describing a new variant, a single inbred strain should be named as the prototype or standard strain.
3.3    Loci within heterochromatin
Individual loci or DNA segments mapped within heterochromatin should be symbolized with D- symbols (for details of naming DNA segments, see Rules for Nomenclature of Genes, Genetic Markers, Alleles, and Mutations in Mouse and Rat). A lowercase h follows the D to indicate the DNA locus is a genetic marker for the heterochromatin region.
Example:
Dh1H
the first DNA segment within the pericentromeric heterochromatin region of Chr 1 discovered at Harwell.
3.4    Centromeres
The centromere itself (as opposed to pericentric heterochromatin) should be denoted by the symbol Cen. Individual loci or DNA segments mapped within the centromere region should be symbolized with D- symbols. It should be noted that at present there is no sequence definition for the centromere; Cen refers to the functional unit of the centromere.
3.5    Telomeres
The telomere should be denoted by the symbol Tel. The symbol Tel may be substituted for D in a locus symbol that refers to a locus recognized by a telomere consensus sequence probe. Symbols for such loci (mapping to the telomere region) are italicized and consist of three parts:
The letters Tel (for telomere)
A number denoting the chromosome
A letter denoting the centromeric or distal end of the chromosome, namely p for centromeric and q for distal (derived from p and q for short and long arms, respectively).
Tel14q
a telomere sequence on Chromosome 14 at the distal chromosome end
Multiple loci assigned to telomeres of individual chromosomes are numbered serially.
Tel14p1
the first telomere sequence mapped at the centromeric end of Chr 14
Tel19q2
the second telomere sequence mapped at the distal end of Chr 19
Telomeric sequences mapped to other chromosome regions should be designated as -rs loci and are sequentially numbered (see Rules for Nomenclature of Genes, Genetic Markers, Alleles, and Mutations in Mouse and Rat and Sawyer et al., 1987).
Example:
Tel-rs2telomere, related sequence 2. This sequence maps at approximately 33cM on Chr 8.
3.6    G-band polymorphisms
When a recognizable and heritable variant in size, staining density, etc. of a particular chromosomal G-band is discovered, this should be indicated by giving the designation of the band affected, in accordance with the standard karyotype of the mouse (Evans 1996), with a superscript to indicate the variant concerned.
Chr 17A2s
small A2 band in Chr 17
When a supernumerary band becomes visible, this may be due to a small duplication, and if so should be designated as such. If the supernumerary band is due not to a duplication but to a further resolution within a band, then a new band should be designated as a subdivision of the appropriate known band (see Section 1 above).
4.   Use of Human Chromosome Nomenclature
Chromosomal complements may be described using the type of nomenclature used for human chromosomes when dealing with whole arm changes. In this case the number of chromosomes is specified, followed by a comma and a specification of the whole arm chromosome change. Symbols used to designate these whole arm chromosome changes are:
&quot;+&quot; to indicate the presence of a specific additional autosome
&quot;–&quot; to indicate the absence of a specific autosome
&quot;O&quot; to indicate a missing sex chromosome
Additional Xs or Ys to indicate supernumerary sex chromosomes
For mosaics a double slash is used to separate the components of the chromosomal mosaic.
Examples:
41,XY+13
the normal mouse male complement with an additional copy of Chr 13
39,XO
a female mouse complement missing a Chr X
39,XO//41,XYY
a mosaic where one component is a female XO and the other a male component carrying an extra Chr Y.

• If you need to choose among several references, select one by
considering the level of evidence, open-access, year of publication,
and published in the target journal.
• Meticulously check the final reference list for errors.

            <Notes>Figures (generic)
• Make a deliberate choice early in the writing process on which key findings to present in figures.
• The title should reflect what is shown.
• Ensure that figures are self-explanatory.
• Do not repeat information from figures in the text but emphasize the important findings.
• Design figures to make them clear and easy to read.
• Start each figure on a new page, after the reference list.
(Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 66 (2013) 1197)
You can paste here your figures, just for reference.
All scientific journals require submission of artwork separately, usually in formats such as TIFF, EPS, JPG and PDF. Color files must usually be in CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) mode (Use Photoshop to convert the color space)
For Photographs and non-EPS graphs ensure that you save at least at 300 dpi resolution. Check a recent issue of your target journal for the usual size of figures.
Graphs
• Prepare the results and data of the study before drafting the graphs.
• The flow of the graphs should tell a logical story.
• Choose the appropriate graph type to match the study data.
• Design, provide legends and label the graphs carefully so that they are clear and easy to understand.
WHEN TO PRESENT DATA IN GRAPHS:
• Show trends and patterns in the data.
• Paint an interesting picture and make a visual impact.
• Reveal relations between variables in the data.
COMMON ERRORS:
• Information in the text is duplicated in graphs, or information in graphs is duplicated in tables.
• The graph does not have proper legends.
• The wrong type of graph is chosen to represent the data.
• The graph is not plotted to scale. Data is not labelled,
is inconsistent, interrupted, or exaggerated to produce the desired effect.
• The source of previously-published data is not credited.
• The misuse of pseudo three-dimensional graphs.
Images
• Illustrations provide visual information.
• Effective illustrations improve the readability of a scientific paper as they make a visual impact.
• Prepare legends and label illustrations clearly so that they are easy to understand.
• Submit illustrations in a format that will provide high-quality reproduction.
COMMON ERRORS:
• Photographs show much more than the relevant parts, i.e. extraneous material.
• Patients or subjects can be clearly identified in the photographs and images.
• Authors’ names and affiliations appear on the images.
• Photographic/halftone figure scans are embedded in a Microsoft Word document, causing significant pixel resolution to be lost.
• Annotations on the figures are too small or are illegible.

These can be written first, as you are doing your experiments and collecting the results.
Introduction
Discussion
Conclusion
Write these sections next, once you have decided on your target journal.
Title
Abstract
Write your Title and Abstract based on all the other sections
Writing titles and abstracts
The importance of writing a good title and abstract
The title and abstract are the most visible parts of your article.
During peer review, the title and abstract are used when we invite reviewers. Invited reviewers are asked to decide whether they wish to review the manuscript on the basis of the title and abstract alone.
If and when the manuscript is published, more people will read the title and abstract than the whole article. In fact, many people will only read the title and abstract, and may only try to read them once. It is thus important to catch the reader's attention by making the title and abstract as concise, accurate and readable as possible.
Most people rely on electronic search engines to find articles. Usually they search through databases that contain only the title, author list and abstract of articles, excluding any keywords attached to the article by its authors. This is the case, for example, for the National Library of Medicine's databases, including Medline and PubMed. It is therefore important to include in the title and/or abstract the words that potential readers of the article are likely to use during a search.
If you want to make sure that your article is found as a &quot;Related Article&quot; in PubMed searches, please bear in mind that the algorithm used for this functionality gives more weight to less common terms, words used more frequently within a document, and terms in the title.
Titles: The key to ensuring your article will be foundThe title is an essential way to bring the article to potential readers' attention, especially in those cases where the database being searched does not include the abstract of the article. The title must therefore be as accurate, informative and complete as possible.
Some tips on titles
Be as descriptive as possible and use specific rather than general terms: for instance, include the specific drug name rather than just the class of drug.
Use simple word order and common word combinations: e.g. &quot;juvenile delinquency&quot; is more commonly used than &quot;delinquency amongst juveniles&quot;.
Avoid using abbreviations; they could have different meanings in different fields.
Avoid using acronyms and initialisms: e.g. &quot;Ca&quot; for calcium could be mistaken for &quot;CA&quot;, which means cancer.
Write scientific names in full, e.g. Escherichia coli rather than E. coli.
Refer to chemicals by their common or generic name instead of their formulas.
Avoid the use of Roman numerals in the title as they can be interpreted differently: for instance, part III could be mistaken for factor III.
Abstracts: Selecting the most important information
The abstract must outline the most important aspects of the study while providing only a limited amount of detail on its background, methodology and results. Authors need to critically assess the different aspects of the manuscript and choose those that are sufficiently important to deserve inclusion in the abstract.
Once the abstract is ready it can be helpful to ask a colleague who is not involved in the research to go through it to ensure that the descriptions are clear. After the manuscript is written, the authors should go back to the abstract to check that it agrees with the contents of the final manuscript.
Abstract structure
Abstracts should have a structured format. This serves several purposes: it helps authors summarize the different aspects of their work; it makes the abstract more immediately clear; and it helps peer reviewers and readers assess the contents of the manuscript.
The abstract structure varies between journals and between types of article. Authors should check that the abstract of their manuscript is consistent with the requirements of the article type and journal to which the manuscript will be submitted. Please note that the abstract requirements differ between the biology and medical journals in the BMC series published by BMC, for example.
The abstracts of manuscripts submitted to the biology journals in the BMC series should be structured as follows:
Background: This should place the study into the context of the current knowledge in its field and list the purpose of the work; in other words, the authors should summarize why they carried out their research.Results: This section should describe the main findings of the study.Conclusions: A brief summary of the content of the manuscript and the potential implications of its results.The abstracts of manuscripts submitted to the medical journals in the BMC series should be structured as follows: Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions. The Background, Results, and Conclusions are as for the biology journals, above. In addition, the Methods section should summarize how the study was performed and mention the different techniques employed. It should also include details of any statistical tests employed.
For further details on the requirements of any particular journal published by BMC, please check the relevant 'Instructions for Authors' page.
Some tips on writing abstracts
Check the abstract length: Abstracts should not exceed 350 words. Abstracts that are too long lose their function as summaries of the full article, and excess words may be omitted by some indexing services.
Include synonyms for words and concepts that are in the title: e.g. if referring to 'stillbirths' in the title mention 'perinatal deaths' in the abstract (if appropriate).
As in the title, use simple word order and common word combinations.
Make sure the salient points of the manuscript are included, but be consistent; the abstract should only reflect those points covered in the manuscript.
Minimize the use of abbreviations.
Avoid citing references.</Text>

            <Title>The review process</Title>
            <Text>The Frontiers Collaborative Review aims to maximize manuscript quality while ensuring the rights of authors to submit their work for a rigorous, constructive and transparent review process.
Peer review is handled by active researchers and scholars, carefully appointed to our Editorial Boards according to strict criteria of excellence, and who certify the accuracy and validity of research with their names on the published article.
We believe peer review must be centered on objective criteria for the validity and quality of the work presented. At the same time, it should be rigorous, fair, constructive, accountable and transparent for everyone involved. Last, but not least, peer review needs to be efficient.
To achieve this, we developed a unique, award-winning Collaborative Review Forum that unites authors, reviewers and the handling Editor online and brings the highest quality service to all participants of the review process. We continuously innovate to provide cutting-edge tools and services for an efficient peer review. All submissions, including those that are part of themed Research Topic article collections, undergo the same rigorous review process.

General Principles
Frontiers upholds strict quality standards for manuscripts and the peer-review process through clear criteria and dedicated teams. Manuscripts that pass these criteria are accepted, those that do not pass the criteria are rejected. Frontiers does not reject manuscripts based on their perceived potential impact, nor does it set a rejection rate – formal or informal. Instead, we judge the value and validity of presented work through rigorous quality checks and empower our Editorial Boards to take charge of content decisions. Handling Editors and reviewers can recommend rejection at any time; Editors make acceptance decisions; and Chief Editors make acceptance and rejection decisions. Frontiers’ dedicated in-house Research Integrity Team performs pre- and post-review quality screens and can reject articles that do not meet acceptance criteria. This model ensures rigorous peer review, rapid decisions and the publication of high-quality research.
What is expected of everyone involved?
Authors must submit a manuscript that has significant scholarly value and falls within the scope of the journal. They must comply with all editorial and ethical policies and take all reviewer and editor comments into consideration.
Reviewers are subject experts and evaluate manuscripts by using the quality assessment tool and designated review questionnaire that prioritize scientific quality, rigor and validity. They evaluate the methodology of a study for solidity and rigor, ensure the research provides valid conclusions, and is supported by sufficient data.
Editors are subject experts and assess the peer-review process and manuscripts meticulously. They only endorse publication if the reviewers validate the contents of a manuscript.
Chief Editors, handling Editors, reviewers and authors are guided and supported by the Frontiers Peer Review Team, a dedicated team that upholds and ensures high quality standards for manuscripts and the peer review itself, certifying the quality, scientific rigour and validity of research articles and promoting collaboration among authors, reviewers and editors.
If an editor, reviewer or author is in doubt on how to proceed during the peer-review process, the Frontiers Peer Review Team is the main point of contact for guidance, with two specialized sub-teams: the Research Integrity Team and the Editorial Review Operations Team.
Manuscript Quality Standards
The Frontiers Research Integrity Team ensures that manuscripts adhere to high quality research and ethical standards and prevents the publication of any manuscripts that are below our quality standards.
Frontiers applies the following criteria for acceptance and rejection of manuscripts:
Acceptance Criteria
All submissions accepted at Frontiers must be VALID:


Valid research question and hypothesis, with a relevant theory to which the research question is being posed
Applies correct and transparent methodology, and the study design and materials are clearly laid out
Language and presentation are clear and adequate, figures and tables are in line with scientific norms and standards
In line with Frontiers author guidelines on editorial and ethical policies
Determined by grounding in existing literature through sufficient referencing and appropriate coverage of the relevant literature

Rejection Criteria
A submission may be rejected at any stage during initial validation, peer review or final validation for the following reasons:


The manuscript does not have a valid research question or hypothesis
There are clear objective errors in the methodology of the study design, data collection or analysis
The manuscript does not conform to our editorial policies as it is not original, is plagiarized, or is a duplication of previous work
The language and presentation of the manuscript is not of sufficient quality for a rigorous and efficient peer review to take place
The study violates our ethical policies by not complying with privacy protection guidelines, ethical review board approval guidelines and internationally recognized standards for research involving humans or animals
The authors have not adhered to our authorship guidelines or have fabricated, falsified data or manipulated images and figures in a deceitful manner
The references are clearly biased (geographical, self-citation, school of thought) and do not reflect the current status of knowledge in the field
Based on biased or faulty analyses, the study’s conclusions are misleading and could even pose a public health threat
The study investigates a pseudoscientific research question

Peer Review Quality Standards
The Editorial Review Operations Team ensures a high quality, rigorous and efficient peer-review process for all manuscripts submitted to Frontiers. The team establishes and upholds the peer-review guidelines for editors, reviewers and authors, which incorporate the best practices and editorial policies.
The team is responsible for upholding the following quality standards:
Editors and reviewers are experts in the subject of the manuscript, with necessary expertise to evaluate the research by having established a sufficient research work or publication record on the same or related research area;
Editors and reviewers have no relationship to the authors and/or research that would affect the objectivity of the peer-review process;
In case the peer review is ongoing, and it is discovered that editors or reviewers do not have the relevant expertise or have a conflict-of-interest, they can be revoked and replaced during review by the Peer Review Team and/or the editor;
Reviewers thoroughly complete the subject-specific questionnaire provided to assess the scientific rigour, quality and validity of the manuscript they are reviewing. Review reports are verified to ensure they provide a constructive assessment of the manuscripts’ validity and quality to the authors;
Final editorial checks to verify that the peer-review process adhered to the quality standards, that the reviewers’ and editor’s concerns have been addressed and that the manuscript is ready for publication;
Only high-quality manuscripts that pass our acceptance criteria are published.
 
In accepting a peer-review assignment with Frontiers, editors and reviewers agree to:
Have the necessary expertise to judge the manuscript’s quality, rigour and validity;
Submit thorough, high-quality review reports;
Provide feedback in a timely manner, remaining responsive to collaborate with the authors;
Behave in a professional, ethical way and be constructive during interactions with the editors, authors and editorial team.
 
In parallel, for manuscripts to remain under consideration for publication, the authors must:
Remain engaged with the peer-review process and responsive for queries from the editors, reviewers or Frontiers Editorial Office;
Behave in a professional way, use constructive, respectful language when communicating with the editorial board members, reviewers or Frontiers Editorial Office, and collaborate effectively during the peer-review process.
Participants in the peer review will be removed from their assignments if they do not adhere to and meet these review standards. Manuscripts can also be rejected should the authors be unresponsive for an extended period of time (30 days) or use inappropriate, offensive language when communicating with the Editorial Board members or Frontiers Editorial Office.
Pillars of Peer Review
The Frontiers Collaborative Review provides and guarantees:
Collaborative Review
Our Collaborative Review Forum unites authors, reviewers and the handling Editor (called the Associate Editor for editorial board members, or Topic Editor for Research Topics) – and if need be the Specialty Chief Editor – in a direct online dialogue, enabling quick iterations and facilitating consensus. Editors and reviewers work with the authors to improve their manuscript.
Objective Review
Frontiers promotes a strict separation between review and evaluation. Frontiers editors and reviewers have the mandate to focus on objective criteria evaluating the quality, rigour and validity of the study and to ensure that the results are valid, the analysis is correct, and the quality high. We publish all papers assessed to be valid and of good quality. Reviewers may recommend rejection based upon objective errors and the criteria for rejection. Judgments regarding the importance of a paper can be made through open post-publication reviews. We also use objective impact metrics – reflecting the opinion of the entire community – to spotlight outstanding discoveries.
Rigorous Review
Frontiers provides a review questionnaire template to make reviews systematic and convene the efforts of reviewers on objective issues. The review must focus solely on the quality of both the research and the manuscript, and must aim at providing constructive comments to bring the final paper to its best quality. This allows fair, rapid, comprehensive and comparable assessment of research. The evaluation of the research will be done successively by means of the article-level impact metrics. Moreover, Frontiers provides authors with the highest quality review service by assigning only the world’s top researchers to the Frontiers’ Chief and Associate Editorial Boards.
Transparent Review
To guarantee the most rigorous and objective reviews, the identities of reviewers remain anonymous during the review period. When a manuscript is accepted for publication, the names of the reviewers who endorsed its publication appear on the published article, without exceptions. If a reviewer recommends rejection or withdraws during any stage of this process, his/her name will not be disclosed. The handling Editor’s name is also made public on the published article, acknowledging their contribution.As a result of this process, reviews are conducted constructively, with editors and reviewers holding a level of accountability and responsibility for the paper by providing rigorous feedback that delivers the highest possible quality publication. Please also note that, as Frontiers operates a single-blind peer review process, the authors’ identities are known to the reviewers.
Efficient Review
Frontiers’ publishing platform is custom-built. We offer one of the fastest systems amongst academic publishers. Our Collaborative Review Forum guides authors, reviewers and editors smoothly through the review process and alerts them when any action is required. This has shortened the average time from submission to final decision to 90 days.
Full Peer Review Guidelines
The full Frontiers Collaborative Peer Review consists of two phases.
Independent ReviewDuring the Independent Review phase, the reviewers assess the manuscript independently from each other and from the authors, according to a standardized review template. These templates are adapted to each article type.
Interactive ReviewDuring the Interactive Review phase, authors and reviewers can interact with each other through real-time comments in the discussion forum – with the aim of addressing all concerns about the manuscript. The handling Editor oversees the review process, and, if required, the Specialty Chief Editor can also enter the Review Forum.
The following articles types undergo a full peer review:
Original Research, Review, Brief Research Report, Case Report, Clinical Trial, Community Case Study, Conceptual Analysis, Curriculum Instruction and Pedagogy, Data Report, General Commentaries, Hypothesis &amp; Theory Articles, Methods, Mini Review, Opinion, Policy and Practice Review, Policy Brief, Perspective, Registered Report, Study Protocol, Technology &amp; Code, Systematic Reviews
Post-Submission Steps
Once a manuscript is submitted, the Frontiers Editorial Office conducts a pre-screening for validation of research integrity and quality standards. If a manuscript meets Frontiers’ quality criteria, an Editor from the relevant specialty section is invited to handle the manuscript’s peer-review process. After a preliminary content check, the editor decides whether to send the manuscript for review or to recommend it for immediate rejection to the Specialty Chief Editor.
In the latter case, the Specialty Chief Editor may confirm the handling Editor’s recommendation of immediate rejection due to the following reasons:
Objective errors in the methods, applications, or interpretations were identified in the manuscript that prevent further consideration
Ethical issues were identified in the manuscript that prevent further review or publication
The content of this manuscript does not meet the standards of rigor required by the journal to be considered for publication (see full rejection criteria above)
The Specialty Chief Editor may, nevertheless, override the handling Editor's recommendation and decide that the manuscript deserves being reviewed before a final decision is made. In this case he/she will assign the manuscript to a new handling Editor for another assessment.
The handling Editor invites experts to review the manuscript; most article types require at least two reviewers to complete a review. These reviewers can either be invited from the Frontiers Board of Review Editors or appropriately recruited among experts in the field.
Independent Review Phase
The reviewers are asked to submit the standardized Frontiers Independent Review Report via the online Collaborative Review Forum within 10 days after accepting the assignment. This is done independently by each reviewer. The handling Editor is automatically notified as soon as each of the Independent Review Reports is submitted.
Once all reviewers have submitted an Independent Review Report, the Editor is responsible for activating the next phase, i.e. the Interactive Review, to release the review reports to the authors. If the Editor would like to recommend rejection during the Independent Review phase, they can do so by activating the Interactive Review phase with major concerns, providing the authors with the reports and a unique opportunity for rebuttal during a defined timeframe.
Interactive Review Phase
Once the editor activates the Interactive Review phase, authors are immediately notified and granted access to the Collaborative Review Forum, where they are able to view the reviewers' comments. Authors are asked to respond and/or submit a revised manuscript within 12, 17 or 21 days, depending on the level of revisions requested by the editor. If the authors are unresponsive to multiple communication attempts, the Frontiers Editorial Office will send a final email to the authors with a 7-day deadline to respond. Following this, the Editorial Office reserves the right to withdraw the manuscript from the review process.
The Editor can access and post comments in the Collaborative Review Forum at any time. Additionally, the Editor monitors the discussions occurring between authors and reviewers within the Forum and ensures not only the timeliness, but also the constructiveness, of the participants’ interactions.
Should a dispute arise at this stage, the Editor must act as a mediator, working with all parties involved to resolve the issues and even inviting new reviewers for further opinions if needed. If the disagreement persists, the Specialty Chief Editor is then invited to enter the Interactive Review phase, assess the situation, and take a final decision as to whether the review should be ended by rejecting the manuscript or continued – potentially, but not necessarily, with a new handling Editor and set of reviewers.
When a disagreement cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of a reviewer, he/she can choose to recommend rejection of the manuscript. The handling Editor is then informed of the rejection recommendation and the reason. A reviewer can also withdraw from the review at any time. In both cases of rejection recommendation and withdrawal, the reviewer will no longer participate in the Review Forum, but may continue to follow the manuscript status under their My Frontiers page. The Editor is informed of the reviewer recommendations and may choose to further recommend rejection to the chief editor, or invite other reviewers to receive additional expert opinions. If a reviewer submitted an Independent Review Report prior to withdrawal or rejection recommendation, the report will be maintained in the Review Forum for participants to access throughout the review process. It is not removed or lost.
During this phase, a manuscript may be rejected at any point for the following reasons:
Objective errors in the methods, applications, or interpretations were identified in this manuscript that prevent further consideration;
Ethical issues were identified in this manuscript that prevent further review or publication;
The content of this manuscript does not meet the standards of rigor required by the journal to be considered for publication;
The manuscript could not be sufficiently revised by the authors to address the concerns raised by the reviewers or editor during the review process;
Other reasons that meet the rejection criteria.
The review is complete only once all reviewer and editor comments have been satisfactorily addressed by the authors.
Arbitrations
Should a dispute arise that may result in the rejection of the manuscript, the authors may trigger an arbitration. In the first place, the handling Editor will mediate and involve all reviewers in a discussion aimed at resolving the dispute.
If a resolution cannot be agreed upon, the Specialty Chief Editor is alerted and can opt to bring in additional reviewers and handling Editor for consultation. A manuscript must be rejected if the arbitration rules that any of the rejection criteria are met.
Reviewers are entitled to trigger an arbitration, too, if they judge that the authors are reluctant to make required changes. Reviewers may of course recommend rejection at any time or withdraw from the review process if they disagree with the arbitration ruling (in both cases their identity remains undisclosed). The withdrawal of a reviewer requires the recruitment of a new one, which slows down the process. Therefore, authors are encouraged to cooperate as much as possible in addressing the concerns of the reviewers involved with their manuscript. Should an arbitration rule in favor of the authors, then the manuscript can be accepted even if there was a previous rejection recommendation.
Manuscript Acceptance
If the reviewers endorse the publication of the manuscript in its current form, they must finalize their Interactive Review Reports, which automatically notifies the handling Editor. For acceptance to be considered, the manuscript must:
Be VALID as defined in the acceptance criteria
Have an Editor and the minimum number of independent reviewers assigned for the article type
Be endorsed by a majority of the assigned, non-withdrawn reviewers
The Editor can then either accept the final version of the manuscript or request further changes as necessary, typically within a few days. Acceptance of a manuscript can be decided by the handling Editor and does not require the approval of the Specialty Chief Editor.
Acceptance by the handling Editor moves the article into the Final Validation phase, during which Frontiers’ in-house Peer Review Team performs final technical and quality checks, including whether the review was performed adequately. Should the manuscript fail the final checks, it can either be put back into review to address the identified issue(s) or else the provisional acceptance decision can be overridden and the manuscript will be rejected at this stage without publication.
The Article Processing Charge (APC) is payable within 30 days of acceptance and is required before final publication of the manuscript.
Manuscript Rejection
If the minimum required number of reviewers to endorse the manuscript is not met (usually two, and must be a majority), then the handling Editor must recommend to the Specialty Chief Editor that the manuscript be rejected for publication. The final rejection decision is usually made by the Specialty Chief Editor but can also be made by the Frontiers Research Integrity Team based on the rejection criteria.
If a manuscript is rejected, no Article Processing Charges or other fee is charged.
Short Peer Review Guidelines
The following articles types are attributed a shortened peer review:
Editorials, Book Reviews, and Classifications.
Short peer reviews differ from full peer reviews in two aspects: they are directly forwarded to the Interactive Review Phase and they may be reviewed by the handling Editor alone. It is up to the Editor’s consideration if further reviewers are invited to the review process.
Therefore, following submission, an Editor of the relevant Frontiers Specialty is immediately invited to take on the manuscript editorial assignment, which encompasses the role of the reviewer, too. Since no Independent Review Report is required, the manuscript enters the Interactive Review Phase immediately.
Interactive Review, manuscript acceptance and rejection follow the same rules as for full peer reviews.
Editorial Policies
Conflicts of Interest
Frontiers is committed to upholding the highest standards of publication ethics and takes publication malpractice and conflicts of interest very seriously (see our Author Conditions). Personal, financial and professional affiliations or relationships can be perceived as conflicts of interest. All authors and all members of Frontiers’ Editorial Boards are required to disclose any actual and potential conflicts of interest at submission or upon accepting an editorial or review assignment.
The Frontiers review system is designed to guarantee transparent and objective editorial and review process, and because handling Editor and reviewers' names are made public upon the publication of articles, conflicts of interest will be openly apparent.
Authors
As an author, disclosure of any potential conflict of interest should be done during the submission process. Consider the following questions and make sure you disclose any positive answers. If you failed to disclose any of the potential conflict of interest below during submission, please contact the Frontiers Editorial Office with the details as soon as possible.
Did you or your institution at any time receive payment or services from a third party for any aspect of the submitted work?
Do you have financial relationships with entities that could be perceived to influence, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what you wrote in the submitted work?
Do you have any patents and copyrights, whether pending, issued, licensed and/or receiving royalties related to the research?
Do you have other relationships or activities that readers could perceive to have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what you wrote in the submitted work?
Associate, Topic and Review Editors
Associate Editors, Review Editors and external reviewers are requested to fill a questionnaire before taking on an assignment to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. Research Topic Editors are also asked to complete the questionnaire upon assignment to a manuscript under their Research Topic. If you can answer yes to any of the questions below, Frontiers considers this to be a potential conflict of interest. Such potential conflicts might be between the editor and authors, the reviewers and authors, or the reviewers and editors. Editors are recommended to invite independent reviewers from a broad range of institutional and geographic locations to promote diversity of thought and to ensure an objective and fair peer review process.
If you have any doubt about whether a relationship or an interest qualifies as a conflict of interest, it is always better to disclose this potential conflict such that editors and the Frontiers Editorial Office can determine whether it necessitates disclosure on the article, or whether an alternate reviewer or editor should be assigned.
Editors must report actual or potential conflicts of interest to the journal's Editorial Office. Reviewers must report actual or potential conflicts of interest both to the journal's Editorial Office and the editor handling the manuscript.
In case of doubt, please contact your Journal's office by email, or the main Frontiers Editorial Office at editorial.office@frontiersin.org. You should provide the details of the situation and the potential conflict(s) that you would like to report.

FAMILY
1. Are any of the authors a spouse or significant other, a member of the same family or a very close personal friend? Review Editors should also not be a member of the same family as the handling Editor.
COLLABORATIONS
2. Are you currently hosting or have hosted a Frontiers Research Topic with any of the authors within the past 2 years?
3. Are you currently collaborating or have you collaborated on a research project or a publication with any of the authors within the past 2 years?
4. Are you currently collaborating or have you collaborated with any of the authors as an advisor or in any other direct supervisory capacity in the past 3 years?
5. Are you currently collaborating or have you collaborated with any of the authors as a student or in any other direct subordinate capacity in the past 3 years?
Note: Review Editors should not accept assignments if they have a close professional relationship with the handling Editor, which in their view could affect the objectivity of the review.
AFFILIATION
6. Are you affiliated with the same institution as any of the authors? If so, has this resulted in interactions, collaborations, or mutual interests with the authors that would compromise your impartiality in conducting this review?
7. Are you a current member of a committee or department that coincides with an affiliation with any of the authors?
FINANCIAL
8. Do you have a business or professional partnership with any author?
9. Do you have financial interests or business relations with any organization involved in this research or in the preparation of the manuscript?
10. Do you have any financial interest or competing interests in the content of the manuscript that might affect your ability to perform an objective review?

External Reviewers
External reviewers at Frontiers should hold a PhD or an equivalent degree, or the equivalent number of years to a recognized qualification, in the relevant field of research. It is also encouraged that all external reviewers have sufficient experience in scientific publishing, either from the perspective of an author or reviewer.
Frontiers does wish to assist in the development of early career researchers and in offering them exposure to the peer review process. To foster this development, we do allow early career researchers to collaborate in the review process with a senior researcher. Please contact the Frontiers Editorial Office for any questions on how to proceed in such cases.
External reviewers are subject to the same conflicts of interest restrictions as Frontiers Review Editors, and must report actual or potential conflicts of interest both to the journal's Editorial Office and the Editor handling the manuscript.
Publication Ethics
Frontiers takes issues relating to publication ethics very seriously. Frontiers endeavors to follow the guidelines and best practice recommendations published by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Frontiers is a member of COPE and is also represented on the COPE council by its Editorial Office Manager. Frontiers follows the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines including its recommended authorship criteria. Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine is listed as a journal following ICMJE recommendations on its website.
Authors are expected to abide by ethical standards in regard to the attribution of authorship, conflicts of interest, respect of ethical considerations in the use of experimental animal and human participants, financial support disclosures and participation in the peer review process. Additionally, cases of invalid or fraudulent data, plagiarism and dual submissions will constitute grounds for rejection. Please refer to the &quot;Frontiers General Conditions&quot; for complete details on the authors’ responsibilities.
Frontiers editors and reviewers are also expected to abide by ethical standards in regard to conflicts of interest, confidentiality of the reviewed papers, objective evaluation of the work and preservation of reviewers’ anonymity until acceptance in addition to refraining from coercive citation. Editors bear the authority and responsibility for the acceptance of papers..
While Frontiers strives for transparency regarding the identity of reviewers and editors, the external posting of review reports or discussions from the review process is strictly prohibited. As contributions made to the interactive review process come from a number of different parties, the decision to share these contributions are not the reserve of any one party.
Malpractice and Misconduct
Frontiers will investigate allegations of misconduct both before and after publication. Corrections or retractions will be published if necessary, in order to maintain the integrity of the academic record. The Frontiers Editorial Office should be contacted immediately on suspicions of misconduct. Frontiers also investigates allegations made on social media or other relevant websites as we become aware of them.</Text>

            <Title>Publishing in frontiers</Title>
            <Text>In Frontiers, decisions on publication are decided by an external Editorial Board that is not financially incentivized to accept articles. This ensures an independence between the publisher's responsibility to grow and promote the Frontiers journals and the responsibility of the external editors to shape the direction of research.
Frontiers distributes editorial responsibility to the entire Editorial Board. Review Editors are empowered by directly interacting with the authors in the Collaborative Review Forum; Associate Editors are empowered to accept articles; Chief Editors are empowered to enhance the integrity of peer review.
Frontiers has developed the most advanced IT platform for publishing in academic publishing. In particular, Frontiers provides to all of its editors the state of art Digital Editorial Office and myFrontiers platforms. Here they can perform all the operations required to run a Frontiers journal, completely independently and at any time of the day or night.
The Frontiers publishing model is an advanced model that addresses many ails of academic publishing and guarantees editorial independence and distributed power for researchers to shape the direction of research. The model is based on profound principles around peer review and evaluation of research and evolves with community feedback.

Community-run Journals
At Frontiers we operate community-run journals. This means that we put our publishing platform into the hands of competent representatives of the academic community in the objective to publish articles that present sound and valid findings.
We take great care to appoint only leading experts in their fields and specialties according to strict criteria of excellence. Once appointed, researchers are empowered to take editorial decisions to accept or reject articles. Editorial power is distributed across the Editorial Boards, and focuses on the Associate Editors. We trust that these experts, selected according to strict criteria of excellence, provide a seal of approval and certify the soundness of the research presented in the articles, by disclosing their names on the published manuscript. Hence the distributed power at Frontiers comes with responsibility, accountability and recognition of services to the community.
Frontiers operates its programs based on a commitment to science and knowledge conducted in a collaborative spirit, openly shared, and assessed exclusively for its merit. These commitments guide us in defining our editorial policy and processes, which aim to be fair and constructive to authors, effective and efficient. Frontiers seeks technological solutions for many of the routine aspects of publishing process, for which our workflows have been defined – and continue to be revised and improved – with careful consideration of our open-access principles. Gaining efficiency through technology is a central part because it allows us to provide a cost-effective and high-quality service to many authors.
The Frontiers publishing model of community-run journals:
provides a clean separation of editorial responsibility by placing the decisions related to manuscript acceptance in the hands of active researchers, in the spirit of full editorial independence; Frontiers staff of Program and Journal Managers support scientists and scholars in their daily responsibilities and promote the journals and their products, but do not take editorial decisions over content.
defines an objective quality threshold for article acceptance, based on the endorsement of the reviewers and the handling Associate Editor, who assess that the manuscript represents a valid and rigorous contribution, and who publicly validate it with their names on the published article;
balances this responsibility across entire editorial boards, so that a broader group of leaders within any research community can shape the direction of science; the many thousands of Associate Editors at Frontiers are authorized to make the acceptance decision.
empowers Chief Editors with technology that allows them to oversee, intervene and otherwise advise throughout the peer review process
encourages all involved to act ethically and responsibly through its policy of full transparency by publishing the names and affiliations of the reviewers and handling editor on accepted articles.
Transparency, distribution of editorial power across many leaders in a community, and the requirement for a rigorous and constructive review process are a fundamental part of the Frontiers principles to uphold integrity in academic publishing.
Adhering closely to these principles has made Frontiers a recognized leader in publishing innovation. Frontiers brought open access publishing to new fields of research; developed a fully digital independent editorial office that is accessible anytime; introduced article-level metrics to the publishing world in 2008; designed and implemented a Collaborative Review Forum that focuses the review on objective issues and scientific soundness and makes the review process fair, transparent, collaborative, efficient and highly rigorous; pioneered the concept of reviewer recognition by creating the Review Editor role and publishing their names on each article; built Loop, the first open research network to make researchers and their work more discoverable; built a mechanism for the crowdsourcing of research impact based on article-level metrics; and even innovated in outreach by launching and supporting a not-for-profit journal for kids, Frontiers for Young Minds that makes science understandable to the entire world.
 
Journal Structure
The basic editorial unit at Frontiers is the Specialty Section. The Specialty Chief Editor is the editorial authority for the Section. He or she is responsible for establishing the Mission Statement for the Section, as well as for the nomination of a board of Associate Editors. As such, the Specialty Chief Editor is free to define the scope of content to be published in the Specialty Section, in consultation with the Field Chief Editor and the Frontiers Editorial Office, the latter who manages questions of coordination with other journals of our program. The nomination of adequate Associate Editors is of particular importance, because they handle the review process and have the power to accept manuscripts or recommend their rejection.
A Field Journal is a collection of core communities defined by the Specialty Sections. This tiered structure provides the basis for our journals program and, notably, allows for bridging across the limits of traditional discipline boundaries through the &quot;crosslisting&quot; of certain Specialties under two or more relevant fields. This recognizes the importance of emerging fields and improves the discoverability of content across traditional domains.
Content is organized on an even more granular level with Frontiers Research Topics. These are collections of articles around a tightly defined and emerging area of research, allowing the community itself to define the direction of study. As the research landscape quickly evolves, it is becoming ever more important to offer this level of specialization, as the bigger &quot;bins&quot; of a traditional subject areas are no longer adequate. The Frontiers web environment provides a beautiful showcase for all Research Topics, for their participants and their articles, with article-level metrics and the possibility to download the content as an e-book; it also provides direct links to the researchers' Loop profile.
 
Editorial Roles
Our Editorial Boards determine the suitability and quality of scientific and academic content within each discipline, while Frontiers policies ensure that the consistency of Frontiers model is maintained across all of our publications. This ensures that the editors operate in the spirit of full editorial independence. Below are the descriptions of each editorial board role.
THE REVIEW EDITOR
Frontiers Review Editors should hold a PhD with post-doctoral experience, or an equivalent degree with several additional years of academic work, or the equivalent number of years to a recognized qualification in the relevant field of research. Review Editors should have a recognized affiliation and a proven publication record in the specialty area. Review Editors are appointed by Associate or Chief Editors, and listed on our Editorial Board pages. Individual journals may have additional requirements and restrictions for this role.
Frontiers Review Editors receive regular invitations to provide an expert review of submitted manuscripts in a collaborative, transparent and efficient manner during the Frontiers peer review. They provide an independent review report after which they interact with the authors directly to help improve a manuscript.
Frontiers acknowledges the contribution of Review Editors by publishing their name on endorsed manuscripts upon acceptance and online publication of the article. This also ensures full transparency regarding any conflicts of interest. Frontiers has in place processes to support the management of both actual and perceived conflicts of interest, including policy and checklists completed by reviewers before taking on assignments.
THE ASSOCIATE EDITOR
Frontiers Associate Editors are high-impact researchers and recognized leaders in their field, with a strong publication record in international, peer reviewed journals and with a recognized affiliation. They are typically associate professor level or higher, or an equivalent position of equal standing in their field, and are appointed by the Specialty Chief Editors.
Associate Editors make an initial assessment to ensure a manuscript fits within the scope of the Specialty and is scientifically robust. They invite reviewers and directly oversee the interaction between the reviewers and authors during the collaborative peer review process. Based on the reviewers' recommendations, and ensuring all quality, validity and ethical standards have been met, Associate Editors make the final decision on acceptance or recommend a manuscript for rejection to the Specialty Chief Editor.
THE SPECIALTY CHIEF EDITOR
Frontiers Specialty Chief Editors are leading academics and active experts in their field, typically full professors from a recognized institution with a proven track record of publications in international, peer reviewed journals and with editorial experience.
Specialty Chief Editors define the editorial scope for their Specialty and have the responsibility for leading and supervising the activities related to their section and providing support and guidance to the Editorial Board.
Specialty Chief Editors are expected to build and maintain a strong board of Associate Editors to ensure manuscripts are handled by relevant experts and that the peer review is of the highest quality, efficiency and transparency. The Specialty Chief Editors are empowered to act at all levels and at any stage of the peer review process in a system of editorial &quot;checks and balances.&quot;
THE FIELD CHIEF EDITOR
Frontiers Field Chief Editors have an established academic career with an overarching understanding of their whole field and an extensive network of collaborating experts with a very strong track record of publications in international, peer reviewed journals and typically with editorial experience.
As recognized authorities in their area of research, Field Chief Editors define the overall scope of the journal and supervise all activities related to the Field Journal, with the aim to build the community of researchers in the field, drive publications to fully represent the research activity of the community, and build the quality and reputation of the field. They are expected to maintain a strong board of Specialty Chief Editors and to provide support and guidance to the editorial board.
The Field Chief Editor leads the college of Specialty Chief Editors in the implementation of the Frontiers publishing model and collaborative review guidelines, monitoring their tasks, encouraging team spirit, and taking the lead on building the reputation of the journal.
FRONTIERS STAFF
Frontiers staff span a wide range of expertise from scientists to software engineers, who support the operations of the journals and research network. The Editorial Office includes dedicated Journal Managers and Coordinators, who are the main contacts for the Chief Editors at Frontiers. Together with their teams, the managers support editors in using the platform and ensuring journal growth and stewardship. The Editorial Office staff also include teams that coordinate the peer review process and assist authors, editors and reviewers. A further team ensures that submitted and published papers are fit for peer review and adhere to established ethical guidelines.
 
Quality Control
Each Frontiers article strives for the highest quality, thanks to genuinely collaborative interactions between authors, editors and reviewers, who include many of the world's best scientists and scholars. Frontiers is well aware of the potential impact of published research both on future research and on society. Quality is assured by requiring that all submitted manuscripts adhere to the highest ethical standards and demonstrate rigorous and insightful research methodology and conclusions. Inclusion of appropriate reporting guidelines and the adherence of community standards for data availability to support reproducibility are also strict requirements. Failure to meet these requirements precludes review. Research must then be certified by peers before entering a stream of knowledge that may eventually reach the public - and shape society. Therefore, Frontiers only applies the most rigorous and unbiased reviews, established in the high standards of the Frontiers Review System.
Frontiers has a number of procedures in place to support and ensure the quality of the research articles that are published:
EDITORIAL BOARD QUALITY
1) Only leading experts and established members of the research community are appointed to the Frontiers Editorial Boards. Chief Editors, Associate Editors and Review Editors are all listed with their names and affiliations on the Journal pages and are encouraged to publicly list their publication credentials.
ASSOCIATE EDITOR ASSIGNMENT QUALITY
2) Associate Editors oversee the peer review and take the final acceptance decision on manuscripts. Editorial decision power is distributed in Frontiers, because we believe that many experts within a community should be able to shape the direction of science for the benefit of society.
3) Submitting authors can choose a preferred Associate Editor to handle their manuscript, because they can judge well who would be an appropriate expert in editing their manuscript. There is no guarantee for this preference of choice, Associate Editors can decline invitations any time, and the handling Associate Editor can also be over-ridden by the Chief Editor before she/he is invited to edit the article or at any other stage.
4) Associate Editors are mandated to only accept to edit a manuscript if they have no conflicts of interest (as stated here and in their review invitation and assignment emails).
5) Should it become clear that the Associate Editor has a conflict of interest or is unable to perform the peer review timely and adequately, a new Associate Editor can be assigned to the manuscript by the Chief Editor, who has full control to intervene in the peer review process at any time.
6) The Associate Editor initially checks that the article meets basic quality standards and has no obvious objective errors.
REVIEWER ASSIGNMENT QUALITY
7) The Associate Editor can then personally choose and invite the most appropriate reviewers to handle the peer review of the manuscript, including Review Editors from the board or external reviewers.
8) The Associate Editor is aided in this by the Frontiers Collaborative Review Forum software and interface, which suggests the most relevant Review Editors based on a match between their expertise and the topic of the manuscript. Associate Editors can however choose any reviewer they deem adequate.
9) After a certain timeframe and if no reviewers have in the meantime accepted to review the manuscript, the Frontiers platform and algorithmic safety-net steps in and invites the most appropriate Review Editors based on constantly updated and improved algorithms that match reviewer expertise with the submitted manuscript.
10) Review Editors and reviewers are mandated to only accept to review a manuscript if they have no conflicts of interest (as stated here and in their review invitation and assignment emails).
11) Frontiers algorithms are constantly fine-tuned to better match Review Editors with manuscripts, and additional checks are being coded into the platform, for example regarding conflicts of interest.
12) Should it become clear that a particular reviewer has a conflict of interest or is unable to perform the peer review timely and adequately, he or she shall be replaced with an alternative reviewer by the Associate Editor or the Chief Editor, who will be alerted and has full control to intervene in the peer review process at any time.
INDEPENDENT REVIEW STAGE QUALITY
13) In the Independent Review Stage the assigned reviewers perform an in-depth review of the article independently of each other to safeguard complete freedom of opinion.
14) The reviewers are aided by an online standardized review questionnaire – adopted to article types – with the goal to facilitate rigorous evaluation according to objective criteria and the Frontiers Review Guidelines.
INTERACTIVE REVIEW STAGE QUALITY
15) The Associate Editor assesses the reviews and activates the &quot;Interactive Review&quot; – informing the authors of the extent of revisions that are required to address the reviewers’ comments, and starting the Interactive Discussion Forum where authors and also the reviewers get full access to all review reports.
16) Manuscript and review quality at this stage are enhanced by allowing authors and reviewers to discuss directly with each other until a final version of the manuscript is endorsed by the reviewers.
17) Reviewer identity is protected at this stage to safeguard complete freedom of opinion.
18) Reviewers can recommend rejection at this stage if their requests to correct objective errors are not being met by the authors or if they deem the article overall of insufficient quality.
19) Should a dispute arise, authors or reviewers can trigger an arbitration and will alert the Associate Editor, who can assign more reviewers and/or bring the dispute to the attention of the Chief Editor. The Associate Editor can also weigh in on the discussion and is asked to mediate the process to ensure a constructive revision stage.
DECISION STAGE QUALITY
20) The manuscript can only be accepted by the handling Associate Editor if at least two* reviewers endorse the submission for publication (*for full-length article types).
21) The names of the Associate Editor and reviewers are disclosed on published articles to encourage in depth and rigorous reviews, acknowledge work well done on the article and to bring transparency and accountability into peer review.
22) Associate Editors can recommend the rejection of an article to the Chief Editor, who needs to check that the authors' rights have been upheld during the peer review process, and who can then ultimately reject the article if it is of insufficient quality, has objective errors or if the authors were unreasonably unwilling to address the points raised during the review.
23) Chief Editors can at any stage of the peer review step in to comment on the review process, change assigned editors, assign themselves as a reviewer and even as the handling editor for the manuscript, and therefore have full authority and all the mechanisms to act independently in their online editorial office to ensure quality.
SAFEGUARDS AGAINST FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
24) Only leading researchers acting as Associate Editors, who are not part of Frontiers staff, can make acceptance decisions based on reviews performed by external experts acting as Review Editors or reviewers. None have a financial incentive to accept articles, i.e. they are not paid for their role to act as Associate or Review Editors, and any award scheme is not linked to acceptances of manuscripts.
25) Chief Editors receive an honorarium if their Specialty Section or Field reaches certain submission levels. However, this honorarium is based on the total number of submitted articles during a calendar year, and not the number of accepted articles. Therefore they also have no financial incentive to accept manuscripts.
POST-PUBLICATION STAGE QUALITY
26) The Frontiers platform enables post-publication commenting and discussions on papers and hence the possibility to critically evaluate articles even after the peer review process.
27) Frontiers has a community retraction protocol in place to retract papers where serious concerns have been raised and validated by the community that warrant retraction, including ethical concerns, honest errors or scientific misconduct.
CommentsandComplaints
Comments and complaints policy
Frontiers has a highly interactive and transparent publishing model which was established, in part, to engage all the players in scholarly publishing to act responsibly and professionally. All papers are published with the names of the handling editor and the reviewers, who have publicly validated the soundness and academic/scientific validity of each article. However, our duty as a publisher includes correcting the literature whenever it is brought to our attention that an article contains scholarly errors or that authors have committed unethical or illegal acts in relation to their published work. The aim of our policy for comments and complaints is to reflect the founding principles of Frontiers to provide a mechanism that is community-driven through our editors, and that fosters scholarly debate.
If errors are identified in an article, the authors have the possibility of publishing a correction or amendment as a corrigendum. If ethical, legal or scholarly concerns are raised or identified after publication of a nature that could warrant further action, including retraction, Frontiers follows the steps outlined below in order to consult the editors and carry out their decisions.
POST-PUBLICATION COMMENTS POLICY
Readers have the option of highlighting issues related to a specific article to the academic community by:
using the comments section found on each article page
submitting a commentary on the article
The vast majority of expressions of post-publication comments or concerns can be legitimately expressed in this manner. General Commentaries on articles are peer reviewed. Please see our policy on commentaries here.
Frontiers reserves the right to edit or remove comments perceived to be derogatory and/or do not contribute to a scholarly debate on the topic. Authors are automatically notified of comments on their articles by our publication platform. Authors of comments must use their real identity; pseudonyms are not allowed as Frontiers stands for accountability and transparency in the academic discourse. Where Frontiers considers that authors of comments have not followed this policy, appropriate action will be taken, which may include moderation or deletion of the comment, and deletion of their account.
FRONTIERS COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE FOR PUBLISHED ARTICLES
Many complaints are subjective. Conflicts or accusations for which there can be no reasonable expectation of objective assessment by our boards of external editors will not be considered in the context of this policy. Frontiers will only act on official complaints made directly to the Chief Editors and the Frontiers Editorial Office.
Complainants should begin by contacting the corresponding author and attempting to resolve the issue directly, before sending their concerns to the journal. It is appropriate to involve the journal in cases where there are valid reasons for not contacting the authors, if the authors were unresponsive when contacted, or if the discussion in the first instance did not resolve the concerns. When contacting the journal the following procedure should be followed:
1) A reader who would like to raise a concern or complaint regarding a published article in a Frontiers journal should email the relevant Frontiers editorial office with a letter addressed to the Specialty Chief Editor outlining the complaint. The letter must contain the following information:
article [title, authors, journal, publication date, doi]
complainant [title, current affiliation and position, other proof of expertise]
complaint [academic/scientific validity, ethical or legal; summary of main points; adverse consequences anticipated]
details of the complainant’s previous contact with the author or authors of the article
statement that the complainant has no conflict of interest, or declaring any actual or potential conflicts of interest
an annotated PDF of the article should be provided that clearly marks the passages concerned and the reasons why they are of concern
2) Only complaints regarding the scientific/academic validity or ethical or legal aspects of the work or its review will be considered. Complaints will not be considered if they contain personal criticisms of the authors, inappropriate or derogatory language, or where the complainant has used a false or misleading identity. All complaints will be investigated, including anonymous complaints. However, unless a specific and valid reason can be provided for wishing to remain anonymous, Frontiers reserves the right not to update the complainant on the outcome of the investigation. Complainants can request Frontiers and the Chief Editors to handle their complaint confidentially to the extent that this can be accommodated by our internal protocols.
3) Complaints are brought in the first instance to the attention of the Specialty Chief Editor.
3.1) The Specialty Chief Editor, in consultation with the handling Associate or Guest Associate Editor if he/she is available, and / or with additional experts from the editorial board, decides whether there are sufficient grounds for the complaint to be considered further. If they feel that further investigation is warranted, then the authors and Field Chief Editor(s) are informed of the complaint. In certain cases, the publisher or the editors may publish an Expression of Concern indicating that serious objections have been raised. They may also close the case as unsubstantiated at this stage. In this event the complainant is informed that no further action will be taken.
3.2) For complaints having legal implications, Frontiers will seek advice from its legal counsel, who might also contact the editors, the complainant or the authors for further information. Frontiers reserves the right to retract articles that are, or are considered likely to be, in violation of applicable legal principles.
3.3) For ethical concerns, Frontiers will execute the decision of the editors, who will follow widely accepted guidelines such as those by the Committee on Publication Ethics as closely as possible, including concerns around suspicions of data manipulation and data fabrication; if it appears probable that such falsification has taken place, the case can be referred to the authors’ institutions for investigation.
4) If the complaint is upheld by the Chief Editor (as under 4.1), the resulting investigation can result in any of the outcomes detailed below as decided by the Chief Editors:
4.1) The complaint is deemed unsubstantiated – No further action is taken and the complainant is informed that the case has been closed. Further communication by the complainant on the subject will only be considered if additional information to substantiate the concerns is brought forward.
4.2) Investigation into the complaint identifies errors that justify the publication of a corrigendum – The Chief Editors will detail to the authors the points needed to be addressed in the corrigendum. Frontiers will work with the authors to ensure a corrigendum is published that satisfactorily deals with the issues identified in the Chief Editors’ decision. If the authors refuse the Chief Editors will proceed without the authors’ consent to correct the literature and/or may initiate retraction.
4.3) Investigation into the complaint reveals author bias on a contentious or controversial subject – The editors decide on the most appropriate action to address the concerns, which can range from retraction to, for example, inviting a commentary on the article providing a balanced and objective context. The Chief Editors will decide on the potential authors to be invited to write the commentary. The commentary will be peer reviewed by a handling editor and reviewers not associated with the original article.
4.4) Investigation into the complaint indicates that a retraction needs to be considered and further examined – An Expression of Concern may be published to notify readers of an ongoing investigation. The editors may consult further experts or the institutions concerned to reach a decision and under exceptional circumstances may form a committee to ensure a broader representation of views.
4.5) Investigation into the complaint exposes an irrefutable reason for a retraction – The editors endeavor to work together with the authors to retract the article, but can do so even without the authors’ consent. The Committee on Publication Ethics retraction guideline will be followed where applicable. A retraction notice will be published detailing the reasons for retraction.
5) Complainants should note that investigations may take some time to conduct. Frontiers is under no obligation to divulge the status of the investigation until a decision has been reached by the editors. When a notice is published, it will be brought to the attention of the complainant; Frontiers has no obligation to provide the complainant with additional detail concerning the decision. Furthermore, Frontiers reserves the right to cease communication with complainants who do not remain cordial in their contacts with Frontiers staff or Editors.</Text>

            <Title>Tables</Title>
            <Notes>• Make a deliberate choice early in the writing process on which key findings to present in tables.
• The title should reflect what is shown.
• Ensure that tables are self-explanatory.
• Do not repeat information from tables in the text but emphasise the important findings.
• Design tables to make them clear and easy to read.
• Start each table on a new page, after the reference list.
(Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 66 (2013) 1197)
• Tables are used to present complex data in a concise and organised manner.
• Prepare the results and data of the study before drafting the tables.
• The flow of the tables should tell a logical story.
• Design, title and label the tables carefully so that they are easy to understand.
WHEN TO PRESENT DATA IN TABLES:
• Precise numerical data rather than proportions or trends.
• Large numbers of related data.
• Summarise information that will be clearer in a tabular form rather than in a running text.
• Complex information that will be clearer in a table than in a text form or a graph.
COMMON ERRORS:
• Tables in the manuscript are not cited in the text.
• Tabular data do not agree with the data given in the text.
• Inaccurate arithmetic for columns (e.g. numbers do not add up).
• Information in the text is duplicated in the tables.
• Information in the tables is duplicated in graphs.

PLANEJAMENTO DE PROJETOS
Antes de enviar uma proposta à CEUA, pesquisadores e professores devem considerar as seguintes questões no planejamento de um projeto:
os benefícios obtidos com o uso dos animais serão potencialmente maiores do que os impactos negativos sobre o seu bem-estar?
os objetivos do estudo podem ser atingidos sem a utilização dos animais?
as espécies de animais selecionadas são as mais apropriadas?
o estado biológico (incluindo genético, nutricional, microbiológico e sanitário) dos animais está adequado?
as instalações que abrigarão os animais, bem como os equipamentos e técnicos são adequados?
todos os usuários envolvidos foram informados sobre os procedimentos planejados?
os usuários envolvidos possuem treinamento e capacitação para realizar os procedimentos propostos no protocolo?
os alunos envolvidos receberam treinamento e serão supervisionados adequadamente?
as condições ambientais (incluindo o tipo de gaiola, ruídos, fotoperíodo, temperatura, umidade, ventilação, densidade de animais em relação ao espaço e estruturas sociais) são apropriadas?
o projeto foi planejado de forma que resultados estatisticamente válidos possam ser obtidos, ou que objetivos educacionais possam ser alcançados utilizando o número mínimo de animais?
caso o potencial impacto da manipulação sobre o animal for desconhecido, a inclusão de um estudo piloto no planejamento do projeto poderá permitir avaliar o impacto sobre o bem-estar do animal? Estudos piloto devem ser considerados como parte do projeto e, nesse sentido, devem ser avaliados pela CEUA com os critérios normais de aprovação de propostas?
algum aspecto do projeto impactará negativamente sobre o bem-estar dos animais? Em caso afirmativo, o que será feito para minimizar ou evitar o impacto negativo?
Quais medidas serão tomadas para a avaliação regular do bem-estar dos animais?
algum dos estudos propostos já foi realizado anteriormente? Em caso afirmativo, por que ele deve ser repetido?
Todas as permissões necessárias foram obtidas (incluindo as de importação, captura, uso, tratamento, eutanásia ou liberação de animais)?
quais medidas serão tomadas quanto ao destino de animais saudáveis ao término do projeto ou protocolo?

As propostas devem conter as seguintes informações, quando for pertinente:

Informação necessária
O título do projeto.
As datas previstas de início e término do projeto ou protocolo.
O nome de todos os envolvidos no projeto ou protocolo; seu papel e detalhes da experiência e treinamento que os qualifica a desempenhar procedimentos específicos utilizando animais.
A origem dos animais e quaisquer permissões exigidas, detalhes dos alojamentos e onde os procedimentos serão feitos.
Benefícios potenciais do projeto ou protocoloUma descrição, em linguagem clara, do (a):	- Contexto geral do projeto ou do protocolo; manutenção ou melhoria da saúde humana e/ou de outros animaisBenefício previsto no:	- Avanço dos conhecimentos de processos biológicos.	- Melhoria no manejo de animais de produção - potencial para atingiros objetivos educacionais ou objetivos ambientais.
Resumo do projeto ou protocoloUm resumo descritivo de como o projeto ou protocolo foi planejado em relação a seus objetivos.
ReduçãoUma descrição clara de:	- Número, espécie e linhagem dos animais solicitados, por grupos de tratamento quando apropriado;	- Razões pelas quais o número de animais é necessário, incluindo se o projeto ou protocolo envolve repetição de projeto ou protocolo anterior e, em caso afirmativo, por que essa repetição é necessária;	- Se há possibilidade de compartilhar os animais bem como de suas estruturas e tecidos animais.
SubstituiçãoJustificar o porquê dos animais serem necessários para a condução do projeto ou protocolo, incluindo: lista de quaisquer alternativas potenciais ao uso de animais; a possibilidade de uso de alguma dessas alternativas, e, em caso negativo, o porquê da inviabilidade de uso.
RefinamentoAs propostas devem identificar e justificar o impacto dos procedimentos sobre o bem-estar animal durante todo o período em que o projeto/aula for conduzido. - Detalhar como o impacto será minimizado. A avaliação de potenciais impactos inclui a descrição de cada etapa das consequências da manipulação para os animais, incluindo:
transporte, aclimatação   e condições de alojamento e manejo;
procedimentos experimentais, entre outros, incluindo dose e via de administração de qualquer substância ou tratamento aplicado e método, volume e frequência das amostras coletadas;
procedimentos cirúrgicos e correlatos incluindo, frequência e doses de tranquilizantes, analgésicos e anestésicos, e métodos para monitorar sua adequação e efeitos adversos;
a sequência e o tempo dos eventos, desde o início até o término, para grupos de animais ou animais individuais;
providências cabíveis em relação ao destino dos animais ao término do projeto, incluindo, se aplicável, o método de eutanásia.
- Identificação de todos os aspectos do uso e gestão de animais, incluindo o manejo, abrigo, manutenção e cuidados em biotério, que possam impactar adversamente sobre o bem-estar dos animais, e como tais impactos podem ser minimizados. A informação fornecida deve incluir detalhes de: 
Refinamento de procedimentos com potencial para reduzir o impacto adverso nos animais;
como o impacto será monitorado, avaliado, quantificado e controlado;
procedimentos para identificar e responder rapidamente a complicações imprevistas.

Monitoramento de animaisDetalhes de como o bem-estar de animais será avaliado ao longo do projeto, incluindo: método e frequência do monitoramento de rotina dos animais; método e frequência do monitoramento de animais durante e após os procedimentos; o que será feito se um problema for identificado, incluindo critérios para intervenção, tratamento ou afastamento dos animais do projeto ou protocolo; nomes e detalhes de contato dos funcionários responsáveis pelo monitoramento diário e pela ação em caso de qualquer emergência.
JustificativasO uso de animais deve ser justificado no projeto ou protocolo, avaliando mérito ético e científico ou educacional versus o impacto potencial ao bem-estar animal. Justificativas específicas podem ser dadas para procedimentos potencialmente estressores ou com mérito ético discutível.Por exemplo: dor e aflição não aliviadas, incluindo os desfechos planejados que possam causar efeitos adversos severos; morte como desfecho; contenção ou confinamento prolongados; produção de anticorpos monoclonais pelo método de ascite; uso de primatas não humanos.
Considerações práticas para auxiliar a CEUA e os responsáveis pelos cuidados dos animais. Especificar qualquer risco especial a outros animais ou humanos decorrente do projeto ou protocolo.
Declaração O projeto ou protocolo deve incluir declaração assinada pelo(s) responsável(is) e demais membros da equipe envolvidos no projeto ou protocolo, indicando que estão cientes dos procedimentos experimentais descritos e que agirão de acordo com a Lei nº 11794, de 2008, e com esta Diretriz. O responsável deve assegurar à CEUA a existência de recursos financeiros e infraestrutura física adequados para a condução dos estudos propostos.

            <Text>Depression and inflammation
Slavich, G. M., &amp; Irwin, M. R. (2014). From stress to inflammation and major depressive disorder: A social signal transduction theory of depression. Psychological Bulletin, 140(3), 774–815. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035302
If review is needed, check the last paragraph (the theory explained) First dACC, anterior insula (and other regions) process external experience --&gt; they modulate inflammation through connections to hypothalamus (HPA axis) and brainstem autonomic nuclei (SNS) --&gt; cortisol decreases inflammation, while SNS results in epinephrine and norepinephrine increases via immune cells receptors --&gt; these cells produce transcript factors NF-kB and AP-1 --&gt; they translocate to the nucleus, bind to cis-regulatory DNA sequences and upregulated expression of proinflamm genes --&gt; these genes (IL1B, IL6, IL8, TNF) result in increased cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alfa --&gt; cytokines act on macrophage-like cells (passage through bbb), activate second messengers and are actively transported through bbb, and also activate microglia and astrocytes to produce more cytokines --&gt; these cytokines act on various brain regions, modulating neurotransmiters (norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin) --&gt; these obviously change behaviour (lead to widespread neurocognitive and behavioral alterations that include aberrations in mood, cognition, motivation, eating patterns, sleep-wake rhythms, pain sensitivity, psychomotor activity, and social and exploratory behavior).
So the theory goes: first brain interpret cues, use HPA axis and SNS to cause cytokines production which in turn act on the brain producing more cytokines and shifts in neurotransmitter balances. 
#
Figure 4. Social signal transduction theory of depression. Social signal transduction theory of depression describes mechanisms that convert, or transduce, experiences of the external social environment into the internal biological environment of depression pathogenesis. (1) Social-environmental experiences indicating possible social threat or adversity (e.g., social evaluation, rejection, isolation, or exclusion) are represented neurally, especially in brain systems that process experiences of social and physical pain. Key nodes in this neural network include the anterior Ínsula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, shown in the insert). These regions project to lower level brain areas (e.g., hypothalamus, brainstem autonomic control nuclei) that have the ability to initiate and modulate inflammatory activity via three pathways that involve (2) the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, (3) sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and (4) efferent vagus nerve. (5) Activation of these pathways leads to the production of glucocorticoids. epinephrine. norepinephrine (NE), and acetylcholine (ACh), which interact with receptors on cytokine-producing cells. Whereas glucocorticoids and acetylcholine have anti-inflammatory effects, epinephrine and norepinephrine activate intracellular transcription factors (e.g., nuclear factor-KB and activator protein 1) that bind to ci.v-regulatory DNA sequences to up-regulate inflammatory gene expression. When this occurs and immune response genes are expressed. DNA is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein. The resulting change in cell function leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 ß [IL-lß], interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a]) that signal the brain to induce cognitive, emotional, and behavioural alterations that include several hallmark symptoms of depression (e.g., sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, altered appetite and sleep, and social-behavioural withdrawal). Cytokines can exert these effects on the central nervous system by (6) passing through leaky or incomplete regions of the blood-brain barrier (e.g.. circumventricular organs, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) and by (7) stimulating primary afferent nerve fibres in the vagus nerve, which relays information to brain systems that regulate mood, motor activity, motivation, sensitivity to social threat, and arousal. Although these neurocognitive and behavioural responses are adaptive during times of actual threat, as depicted in Figure 1, these social signal transduction pathways can also be initiated by purely symbolic, anticipated, or imagined threats—that is, situations that have not yet happened or that may never actually occur. Moreover, activation of these pathways can become self-promoting over time due to neuro-inflammatory sensitization and, as a result, remain engaged long after an actual threat has passed (see Figure 3). In such instances, these dynamics can increase risk for depression in the short-term and possibly promote physical disease, accelerate biological aging, and hasten mortality over the long run. ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone; mRNA = messenger ribonucleic acid.
Type I interferons (IFN-I) have long been heralded as key contributors to effective antiviral responses. More widely understood in the context of acute viral infection, the role of this pleiotropic cytokine has been characterized as triggering antiviral states in cells and potentiating adaptive immune responses. Upon induction in the innate immune response, IFN-I triggers the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which upregulate the effector function of immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells) toward successful resolution of infections. However, emerging lines of evidence reveal that viral persistence in the course of chronic infections could be driven by deleterious immunomodulatory effects upon sustained IFN-I expression. In this setting, elevation of IFN-I and ISGs is directly correlated to viral persistence and elevated viral loads. It is important to note that the correlation among IFN-I expression, ISGs, and viral persistence may be a cause or effect of chronic infection and this is an important distinction to make toward establishing the dichotomous nature of IFN-I responses. The aim of this mini review is to (i) summarize the interaction between IFN-I and downstream effector responses and therefore (ii) delineate the function of this cytokine on positive and negative immunoregulation in chronic infection. This is a significant consideration given the current therapeutic administration of IFN-I in chronic viral infections whose therapeutic significance is projected to continue despite emergence of increasingly efficacious antiviral regimens. Furthermore, elucidation of the interplay between virus and the antiviral response in the context of IFN-I will elucidate avenues toward more effective therapeutic and prophylactic measures against chronic viral infections.
McCauley and colleagues went on to ask exactly how loss of C9orf72 caused these immune defects. The authors measured RNA levels from immune cells of mice that completely lacked C9orf72. They found a striking increase in messenger RNAs encoding both type I interferon-β protein and interferon-stimulated genes (expression of which is activated by interferon proteins) in the mutant cells
C9orf72 em células mieloides reduz a resposta tipo I de interferon —&gt; consequentemente sem C9orf72, a resposta (contra vírus) fica muito alta. Muita atividade de células dendríticas, linfócitos B e T. 
A (rejeição social) aumenta IL-6, e coisarada que causa depressão
Pacientes com ALS e mutação C9orf72 tem elevação da resposta interferon tipo I (visto por sequênciamento de RNA em células coletadas) 
With many studies suggesting that toxic RNAs or proteins are produced by the C9orf72 repeat expansion, considerable work has focused on reducing the levels of these products. For instance, antisense oligonucleotides (short nucleic acids that bind to RNAs containing the C9orf72 repeat and trigger their degradation) have shown promising results in preclinical studies. If the trial is successful, it will be exciting to see whether boosting levels of normal C9orf72 or mitigating the effects of reduced C9orf72 function — perhaps by targeting the STING pathway — will have added benefits.

1.   Introduction
Mice and rats used in the laboratory derive from a variety of sources. Production of inbred strains means that these backgrounds can be defined and thus require nomenclature conventions. It should be borne in mind that genetic drift means that there may still be unknown genetic differences between individuals within strains.
1.1   Mice
Most laboratory mice have contributions from both Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus. There is evidence that smaller contributions also may have come from Mus musculus molossinus and Mus musculus castaneus. Therefore, they should not be referred to by species name, but rather as laboratory mice or by use of a specific strain or stock name. (In addition, some recently developed laboratory mouse strains are derived wholly from other Mus species or other subspecies, such as M. spretus).
Mouse strain names should be registered through the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) at http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/submissions/amsp_submission.cgi.
1.2   Rats
Laboratory rat strains derive from the Rattus norvegicus species. Another species, Rattus rattus, also is used as an experimental model, but has not contributed to the common laboratory rat strains.
Rat strain names should be registered through the Rat Genome Database (RGD) at http://rgd.mcw.edu/tools/strains/strainRegistrationIndex.cgi.
2.   Laboratory codes
A key feature of mouse and rat nomenclature is the Laboratory Registration Code or Laboratory code, which is a code of usually three to four letters (first letter uppercase, followed by all lowercase) that identifies a particular institute, laboratory, or investigator that produced, and may hold stocks of, a mouse or rat strain. Substrains should be identified by Laboratory codes, as should congenic and other strains where several different forms exist that are not otherwise distinguishable. Laboratory codes are assigned by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) (https://www.nationalacademies.org/ilar/lab-code-database).
Examples of Laboratory codes are:

J
The Jackson Laboratory
Rl
W.L. and L.B. Russell
Jr
John Rapp
Mcw  
Medical College of Wisconsin
Kyo
Kyoto University

3.   Inbred Strains and Hybrids
3.1   Definition
Strains can be termed inbred if they have been mated brother x sister for 20 or more consecutive generations, and individuals of the strain can be traced to a single ancestral pair at the 20th or subsequent generation. At this point the individuals' genomes will on average have only 0.01 residual heterozygosity (excluding any genetic drift) and can be regarded for most purposes as genetically identical. Inbred strains must be continuously mated brother x sister (or equivalent) thereafter.
Other breeding schemes can be used to produce inbred strains; consecutive parent x offspring mating may be used, provided that the younger of the parents is always used (i.e., the offspring that is mated to parent is subsequently mated to its offspring). Other breeding schemes are acceptable provided that the inbreeding is equivalent to 20 successive generations of sib mating (Green 1981).
3.2   Nomenclature of Inbred Strains
An inbred strain should be designated by a unique brief symbol made up of uppercase, Roman, letters, or a combination of letters and numbers beginning with a letter. (Note that some pre-existing strains do not follow this convention; e.g., mouse strain 129P1/J).
Care should be taken that mouse and rat strains do not overlap in strain designations. (Note: a few historical examples exist of similar mouse and rat strain designations and these are allowed to stand, with their substrain designations identifying them as unique).
Inbred strains that have a common origin, but are separated before F20 are related inbred strains, and symbols should reflect this relationship.
Examples:

Mouse strains:  
NZB, NZC, NZO
Rat strains:
SR, SS

3.3   Indication of Inbreeding
The number of brother x sister inbreeding generations can be indicated, if necessary, by addition in parentheses of F followed by the number of generations.
Example:
Rat strain:  
ACI/N (F159)


If there is not information as to the total number of generations, but a minimum number of recent inbreeding generations is known, this can be shown by a question mark + the known number of subsequent generations of inbreeding.
Example:
Mouse strain:  
C3H/HeJ-ruf (F?+25)


3.4   Substrains
Established inbred strains maygenetically diverge with time into substrains, due to a number of circumstances:If two branches are separated after 20 but before 40 generations of inbreeding there still will be enough residual heterozygosity that two genetically different substrains will result (Green 1981).
If branches are separated for more than 20 generations from a common ancestor, it is likely that genetic variation between the branches will have occurred by mutation and genetic drift.
If genetic differences are proven by genetic analysis to have occurred between branches.
Substrains are given the root symbol of the original strain, followed by a forward slash and a substrain designation. The designation is usually the Laboratory code of the individual or laboratory originating the strain.
Examples:

IS/Kyo  
Substrain of IS rat strain originating at Kyoto University.
A/He
Substrain of A mouse strain originating from Walter Heston.

If a laboratory originates more than one substrain, serial numbers should be added to the Laboratory code.
Example:

Mouse strains:  
FL/1Re, FL/2Re

(Note that historical exceptions to this rule exist; for example, in mouse, BALB/c is not a substrain, DBA/1 and DBA/2 are separate strains and are not substrains.)
Substrains may give rise to further substrains by continued maintenance by a different investigator or through establishment of a new colony. In addition, substrains arise if demonstrable genetic differences from the original substrain are discovered. In either case, further substrain designations are added, without the addition of another slash.
Examples:

C3H/HeH  
Mouse substrain derived at Harwell (H) from the Heston (He) substrain of C3H.
SR/JrIpcv  
Rat substrain derived at Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences (Ipcv) from the John Rapp (Jr) substrain of SR

Laboratory codes should be accumulated because genetic differences will accumulate with time, the rate depending to some extent on varying levels of quality control at the facilities that have housed and bred the strain or substrain. Organizations distributing mice and rats should include the number of generations the strain has been separated from the parent strain in the information they provide regarding the strain. Strain names can be abbreviated in publications after the first mention of the full proper designation.
3.5   Hybrids
Mice or rats that are the progeny of two inbred strains, crossed in the same direction, are genetically identical, and can be designated using uppercase abbreviations of the two parents (maternal strain listed first), followed by F1. Note that reciprocal F1 hybrids are not genetically identical, and their designations are, therefore, different.
Examples:

D2B6F1
Mouse that is the offspring of a DBA/2 mother and C57BL6/J father. A full F1 designation is (DBA/2N x C57BL/6J)F1.
B6D2F1
Mouse that is the offspring of the reciprocal cross. A full F1 designation is (C57BL/6J x DBA/2N)F1.
CB1BD22F1  
Mouse that is the offspring of two recombinant inbred strains, a CXB1 mother and BXD22 father; full F1 designation is (CXB1/ByJ x BXD22/TyJ)F1.

Further crosses produce offspring that are no longer genetically identical, but it may still be appropriate to give them designations reflecting their parentage, similar to those for F1 hybrids.
Examples:

D2B6F2
are offspring of a D2B6F1 intercross.
B6(D2AKRF1)  
are offspring of a (DBA/2 x AKR/J)F1 male backcrossed to a C57BL/6J female.

In all the above cases, for clarity, the full strain symbols should be given in any publication when the hybrids or crosses are first referred to. If a hybrid is constructed using a substrain known to differ from the &quot;standard&quot; strain genetically and/or phenotypically, the substrain should be indicated in the hybrid symbol; e.g., BALB/cBy = CBy, C3H/HeSn = C3Sn.
Approved abbreviations for common mouse strains are listed below:

129
129 strains (may include subtype, e.g., 129S6 for strain 129S6/SvEvTac)

4.   Strains Made from Multiple Inbred Strains
Mice or rats can be produced that have a defined genetic background, derived from two or more inbred strains, and that may or may not be genetically identical. Such animals should be designated appropriately, according to the breeding scheme that produced them.
4.1   Recombinant Inbred Strains
Recombinant inbred (RI) strains contain unique, approximately equal proportions of genetic contributions from two original progenitor inbred strains. Traditionally, recombinant inbred (RI) strains are formed by crossing animals of two inbred strains, followed by 20 or more consecutive generations of brother x sister matings (Bailey 1971, Taylor 1978). Alternate breeding schemes can be used, such as creating RI strain sets from Advanced Intercross Lines, where F2 animals are nonsib mated for several generations, followed ultimately by 20 or more consecutive generations of brother x sister matings. Note that if backcrossing to one of the parental strains is involved, this will create recombinant congenic strains and should be named accordingly. RI strains should be designated by uppercase one- or two-letter abbreviations of both parental strain names, with the female strain written first, and separated by an uppercase letter X with no intervening spaces. All members of RI sets involving the same two strains will be serially numbered regardless of whether they were created in one or more laboratories. Sequential numbers may be obtained from MGD (email to: nomen@jax.org).
Examples:

CXB  
Recombinant inbred mouse strain derived from a cross of BALB/c x C57BL/6J.

Multiple RI strains derived from the same strain progenitors are given serial numbers.
Examples:

BXD1, BXD2, BXD3  
Members of the BXD set of mouse RI strains derived from a cross of C57BL/6 x DBA/2.
HXB1, HXB2, HXB3  
Members of the HXB set of rat RI strains derived from a cross of SHR/OlaIpcv x BN-Lx/Cub.

If the second strain abbreviation ends in a number (e.g., CX8 RI strains), a hyphen should be used to separate it from the serial number (e.g., CX8-1).
Recombinant inbred strains may be intercrossed for mapping complex traits. Such F1s are called recombinant inbred intercrosses (RIX) and are symbolized the same as F1s between other inbred strains
Example:

(BXD1/Ty X AXB19/Pgn)F1  
An F1 between a female BXD1/Ty and a male AXB19/Pgn.


4.2   4.2 Collaborative Cross Strains
Collaborative Cross (CC) strains are multiparental recombinant inbred lines each with unique contributions from eight original progenitor strains: A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZ)/HILtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. They were developed using a funnel breeding scheme to include all eight progenitor strains in three outbreeding generations, followed by consecutive generations of brother x sister matings (Threadgill and Churchill 2012, Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012).
Collaborative Cross strains are designated by CC, followed by a 4-digit number, a forward slash, and the laboratory code for the institution at which they were bred. The three institutions responsible for the initial breeding, with their respective lab codes in parentheses, are: University of North Carolina, USA (Unc), Tel Aviv University, Israel (Tau), and Geniad, Australia (Geni). As with other inbred strains, additional lab codes are appended when substrains are established.
Example:

CC0058/Unc   
Collaborative Cross strain 0058, developed at University of North Carolina

Collaborative Cross (CC) strains may be intercrossed for mapping complex traits. Such F1s are called recombinant inbred intercrosses (RIX) and are symbolized the same as F1s between other inbred strains.
Example:

(CC0012/Unc X CC2134/Geni)F1   
F1 between a female CC0012/Unc mouse and a male CC2134/Geni mouse.

Once the full F1 designation is specified in a publication, an abbreviated version can be used. In the above example, the abbreviation would be:     RIX:CC(0012 X 2134)
4.3   Mixed Inbred Strains
Incipient inbred stocks or inbred strains that are derived from up to three parental strains (one of which could be a gene-targeted ES cell line) can be designated using upper case abbreviations for the three strains, separated by semicolons. If the strains involved have a donor/host relationship, the strain designation preceding the first semicolon should be the host and the final strain following the semicolon(s) the donor, specifically for targeted mutations where the donor is the ES cell line. Otherwise, the strain abbreviation order may be by primary contributing strain or alphanumeric order. Laboratory codes and serial numbers should be used to distinguish strains produced in different laboratories, or multiple strains from the same laboratory. Because these designations may be used for a mixed stock before it is fully inbred, these stocks should not be assumed to be inbred unless accompanied by an inbreeding generation number (e.g., &gt; F20).
Example:

B6;129-Acvr2tm1Zuk
A mixed strain derived from C57BL/6J and a 129 ES cell line carrying a targeted knockout of the Acvr2 gene.
B6Brd;B6Dnk;B6N-Tyrc-BrdJph3tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi/Mbp  
A mixed strain carrying a targeted mutation of the Jph3 gene. The mixed strain was derived from: C57BL/6Brd-Tyrc-Brd, C57BL/6Dnk, and C57BL/6N and is maintained by the Mouse Biology Program UCD (Mbp).

A mutant strain, incipient or inbred, derived from more than three progenitor strains or having genetic contribution from an unknown source is considered a &quot;mixed&quot; inbred and may be designated as STOCK followed by a space (i.e., no hyphen) and the mutation(s) or chromosome anomaly it carries.
Example:

STOCK Rb(16.17)5Bnr  
An inbred strain of unknown or complex background carrying the Robertsonian translocation Rb(16.17)5Bnr.

Once such a mutant stock achieves inbred status, it should be given the appropriate strain designation. It may be designated using the symbols for the genetic mutations it carries in all uppercase, provided the symbols are short. Because the change in strain name is optional, though strongly recommended, some strains designated as STOCK may be inbred.
Example:

JIGR/Dn  
An inbred strain developed from a mixed background stock carrying the mutation gr (grizzled) and the ji (jittery) allele of Atcay.

When a mutant allele or chromosomal aberration is maintained by crossing animals bearing the mutation to an F1 hybrid at every generation or at alternate generation(s), the stock is designated by the symbol that would be used for that F1, but without the &quot;F1&quot; suffix, and followed by the appropriate allele or chromosome anomaly symbol.
Examples:

B6C3Fe a/a-Dh  
The Dh (dominant hemimelia) mutation is maintained by crossing to a (B6C3Fe a/a)F1 at each generation, but the stock itself is not an F1.

4.4   Recombinant Congenic Strains
Recombinant Congenic (RC) Strains are formed by crossing two inbred strains, followed by a few (usually two) backcrosses of the hybrids to one of the parental strains (the &quot;recipient&quot; strain), with subsequent inbreeding without selection for any specific markers (Demant and Hart, 1986). Such inbred strains will consist of the background recipient strain genome interspersed with homozygous segments of the donor (the amount of donor strain genome depending on the number of original backcrosses, 2 backcrosses will give on average 12.5%).
RC Strains should be regarded as fully inbred when the theoretical coefficient of inbreeding approximates that of a standard inbred strain. For this purpose, one generation of backcrossing will be regarded as being equivalent to two generations of brother x sister mating. Thus, a strain produced by two backcrosses (N3, equivalent to F6) followed by 14 generations of brother x sister mating (F14) would be fully inbred.
RC strains should be designated by an uppercase abbreviation of the two strains, recipient strain listed first, separated by lowercase &quot;c.&quot;
Example:

CcS  
Recombinant congenic strain between BALB/c recipient and STS donor.

Multiple RC strains derived from the same strain progenitors are given serial numbers.
Example:
CcS1, CcS2, CcS3, etc.


If the second strain abbreviation ends in a number (e.g., 129P2), a hyphen should be used to separate it from the serial number.
4.5   Advanced Intercross Lines
Advanced intercross lines (AIL) are made by producing an F2 generation between two inbred strains and then intercrossing in each subsequent generation, but avoiding sibling matings (Darvasi and Soller, 1995). The purpose is to increase the possibility of tightly linked genes recombining.
The symbols should contain the Laboratory code of the laboratory that has produced the line, followed by a colon, the two inbred strain abbreviations, separated by a comma, with the generation number included in the symbol following a hyphen. Generations are designated G3, G4, etc. beginning with the first non-sib cross after the F2 generation.
Example:
Pri:B6,D2-G#   
This is an AIL stock created at Princeton from the inbred strains C57BL/6 x DBA/2. The G number will increase with each generation.

5   Coisogenic, Congenic, and Segregating Inbred Strains
There are several ways in which inbred strains may differ at only a small part of the genome.
5.1   Coisogenic Strains
Coisogenic strains are inbred strains that differ at only a single locus through mutation occurring in that strain. Strains containing targeted mutations in ES cells that are then crossed to, and maintained, on the same inbred substrain from which the ES cells were derived can be regarded as coisogenic, but the possibility of mutations elsewhere should be considered. Similarly, chemically or radiation induced mutants on an inbred background can be considered coisogenic, although other genomic alterations could be present. A coisogenic strain may accumulate genetic differences over time by genetic drift unless periodically backcrossed to the parental strain.
Coisogenic strains should be designated by the strain symbol (and where appropriate the substrain symbol) followed by a hyphen and the gene symbol of the differential allele, in italics.
Example:

129S7/SvEvBrd-Fyntm1Sor  

A targeted mutation of the Fyn gene was produced using the AB1 ES cell line derived from 129S7/SvEvBrd. Chimeric animals were mated to 129S7/SvEvBrd and the allele subsequently maintained on this coisogenic strain.
C57BL/6JEi-tth 
The tremor with tilted head mutation in the C57BL/6JEi strain.

In some cases, such mutations will be maintained in heterozygous condition. It should be noted that this means that the strain designation does not reflect the breeding system, nor indicate the specific genotype of a given mouse or rat.
Example:

C57BL/6J-Aqp2cph  
The congenital progressive hydronephrosis mutation in the aquaporin 2 gene arose on the C57BL/6J strain. It is a coisogenic strain, but because homozygotes are generally juvenile lethal, the strain is maintained by breeding heterozygotes Aqp2cph/+ x Aqp2cph/+.

If the number of generations of inbreeding since the mutation arose in a coisogenic strain is to be shown, it can be indicated by adding the number of generations since the mutation to the number before:
Example:

F110 + F23 indicates 23 generations of brother x sister matings since the occurrence of a mutation at F110 in an inbred strain.

5.2   Congenic Strains
Congenic strains are produced by repeated backcrosses to an inbred (background) strain, with selection for a particular marker from the donor strain (Snell 1978, Flaherty 1981). Congenic lines that differ at a histocompatibility locus and therefore resist each other's grafts are called congenic resistant (CR) lines.
A strain developed by this method is regarded as congenic when a minimum of 10 backcross generations to the background strain have been made, counting the first hybrid or F1 generation as generation 1. At this point the residual amount of unlinked donor genome in the strain is likely to be less than 0.01. (Note that the amount of donor genome linked to the selected gene or marker is reduced at a much slower rate, approximately equivalent to 200/N, where N is the number of backcross generations for N&gt;5 (Flaherty 1981; Silver 1995).
Marker assisted breeding or marker assisted selection breeding, also known as &quot;speed congenics&quot; permits the production of congenic strains equivalent to 10 backcross generations in as few as 5 generations. (Markel et al., 1997; Wakeland et al., 1997). Provided that the appropriate marker selection has been used, these are termed congenic strains if the donor strain contribution unlinked to the selected locus or chromosomal region is less than 0.01. Ideally, descriptions of speed congenic strains in first publications thereof should include the number and genomic spacing of markers used to define the congenicity of the strain. Because speed congenics depend upon thorough marker analysis and can vary by particular experimental protocol, the inbred status of speed congenics should be regarded with caution.
Congenic strains are designated by a symbol consisting of three parts. The full or abbreviated symbol of the recipient strain is separated by a period from an abbreviated symbol of the donor strain, this being the strain in which the allele or mutation originated, which may or may not be its immediate source in constructing the congenic strain. A hyphen then separates the strain name from the symbol (in italics) of the differential allele(s) introgressed from the donor strain.
In cases where the chromosome on which the mutation arose is unknown, e.g., the donor is not inbred or is complex or an F1 hybrid, the symbol Cg should be used to denote this complex genetic origin. The use of the donor strain symbol or Cg is essential to distinguish congenic from coisogenic strains. Cg also is used to designate a strain constructed by crossing together two congenic strains that have been backcrossed separately to the same host background, but where their respective donor strains differ. Cg also is applied where alleles originate from a single donor strain, but the congenic strain also carries other coisogenic alleles. The use of Cg after the period as the donor strain indicates that multiple alleles in the strain name came from more than one source or that the genetic origin of at least one allele in the strain name is uncertain.
Examples:
B6.AKR-H2k
A mouse strain with the genetic background of C57BL/6 but which differs from that strain by the introduction of a differential allele (H2k) derived from strain AKR/J.
SHR.BN-RT1n
A rat strain with the genetic background of SHR but which differs from that strain by the introduction of a differential segment (RT1n) derived from strain BN.
ACI.BUF-Pur1/Mna
A rat strain with the genetic background of ACI onto which a segment from the BUF strain containing the Pur1 QTL has been transferred.
B6.Cg-KitW-44J Gpi1a 
A mouse strain with the genetic background of C57BL/6, but where the donor strain is mixed, the Kit allele originating from C3H/HeJ and the Gpi1 allele originating from CAST/Ei.

If several lines derived from the same host background and donor strains and carrying the same differential allele(s) are available, the individual lines should be distinguished by adding a forward slash followed by serial numbers and Laboratory codes.
Examples:
C.B10-H2b/1Sn
C.B10-H2b/2Sn

Parentheses may be used to show that an inbred, incipient congenic or congenic inbred strain may have a minor contribution from other than the defined host background and donor strain. A single additional strain contribution is indicated by the strain abbreviation in parentheses following the inbred or congenic designation. Multiple, mixed or unknown additional contributions are indicated by the symbol Cg in parentheses. If the donor is designated by Cg, parenthetical information may not be included.
Examples:

B6(C)-mut
A mutation originates on an inbred (e.g., C57BL/6J), is crossed out to or onto another background (e.g., BALB/c) and then is crossed back onto the original background.
B6(Cg)-mut
A mutation arose in C57BL/6, was crossed onto a mixed or undefined background, and then was backcrossed back onto the original C57BL/6 background.
C.129P(B6)-Il2tm1Hor  
A targeted mutation created in a 129 ES cell line and transferred from a B6;129P mixed background to BALB/c.
B6(C)-mut
A mutation arises on a congenic strain carrying another mutation (e.g., B6.C-m) and the original mutation is bred out of the new strain. The new mutation is known to have occurred in a host strain-derived segment of the genome.
B6(C)-mut
A mutation arises on a hybrid or mixed background stock (e.g., B6CF1) and is backcrossed onto one of the original inbred strains (e.g., C57BL/6J). The new mutation is known to have occurred in a host strain-derived segment of the genome.
B6.C(Cg)-mut
A mutation arose on an inbred strain (e.g., BALB/c) and was maintained on a mixed or undefined background (e.g., a linkage-testing stock) before being backcrossed onto a second inbred strain (e.g., C57BL/6).

If the chromosomal segment that has been transferred is defined by several genes or multiple DNA loci, the segment can be defined in the symbol by listing the most proximal and the most distal markers demonstrated to be in the segment in parentheses, separated by a hyphen.
Examples:

B6.Cg-(D4Mit25-D4Mit80)/Lt
A congenic strain made by introducing into C57BL/6J a segment of chromosome 4 from an outbred or mixed strain (=Cg), extending between the two defined markers.
B6.CBA-(D4Mit25-D4Mit80)/Lt  
A similar congenic strain in which the donor chromosomal segment comes from the CBA/J strain.

Note that the markers defining the segment only describe the most proximal and distal markers tested, and this does not imply that there are not other untested markers further proximal or distal. If several lines are made, in the same or different labs that contain the same segment and would be otherwise indistinguishable, then a forward slash, serial number and Laboratory code should be appended.
If necessary, the number of backcross generations should be indicated by N and the number in parentheses following the strain name; generations should not be incorporated into the strain name. Incipient congenics may be given congenic nomenclature at N5, as long as the number of generations of backcrossing is clearly documented in information accompanying the strain. In cases where it is necessary to use more complex mating systems, the generations should be expressed as N equivalents (NE) and the strain regarded as congenic at a minimum of NE10. For example, when backcrossing a recessive gene onto an inbred background, after 10 rounds of backcrossing and intercrossing to recover a homozygote for the next backcross (20 generations), the strain would be at NE10. When a congenic strain is maintained by brother x sister matings after backcrossing, the number of brother x sister generations follows the number of backcross generations, e.g., (N10F6), 10 generations of backcrossing followed by 6 generations of brother x sister inbreeding; (NE12F17), a complex system of backcrosses and intercrosses genetically equivalent to 12 backcrosses, followed by 17 generations of brother x sister matings.
When generating speed congenics N will be less than 10 initially, nevertheless the actual number should be given in parentheses following the N, e.g., N(6), and the details of breeding system and markers used detailed elsewhere in a publication or database.
5.3   Chromosome Substitution or Consomic Strains
Chromosome substitution or consomic strains (Nadeau et al., 2000) are produced by repeated backcrossing of a whole chromosome or its parts onto an inbred strain. The term chromosome substitution strain is a common designation for consomic, subconsomic, and conplastic strains. To create a chromosome substitution strain, transfer of a whole chromosome or a large chromosomal region is carried out, while in congenic strains, the transferred entity is a gene, marker or genomic segment including a specific marker or interval.
5.3.1   Consomic Strains
Consomic strains are produced by repeated backcrossing of a whole chromosome onto an inbred strain. As with congenic strains, a minimum of 10 backcross generations is required, counting the F1 generation as generation 1. For autosomes it is necessary to genotype progeny to ensure that the selected donor chromosome has not recombined with the corresponding recipient chromosome. The generic designation for consomic strains is HOST STRAIN-Chr #DONOR STRAIN.
Examples:

SHR-Chr YBN
In this consomic rat strain, the Y chromosome from BN has been backcrossed onto SHR.
C57BL/6J-Chr 19SPR
In this consomic mouse strain, a M.spretus Chromosome 19 has been backcrossed onto C57BL/6J.
C57BL/6J-Chr 1A/J Chr 3DBA/2J  
In this consomic mouse strain, Chromosome 1 from the A/J strain and Chromosome 3 from the DBA/2J strain have been backcrossed onto C57BL/6J.

Experience shows that on occasion it is impossible to transfer an entire chromosome from one strain to another due to lethal effects on a particular chromosome. For example, a consomic set on which PWD/Ph individual chromosomes were transferred to C57BL/6J revealed that Chr 11 and Chr X cannot be transferred intact. To designate &quot;sections&quot; of transferred chromosomes that contribute to a consomic set, regions can be indicated as a decimal 1, 2, 3, etc.
Thus, a part of Chr 11 of this consomic set would be: C57BL/6J-Chr 11.1PWD/Ph/ForeJ.
Although consomic strains are similar in concept and development to congenic strains, in consomic nomenclature the name of the host strain is not abbreviated, and no period followed by the donor strain is required because the strain of origin is shown in the superscript. Capitalization of all letters in the superscript and non-italicization of the chromosome letter/number and of the superscript distinguish a chromosome identifier from an allele symbol.
5.4   Segregating Inbred Strains
Segregating inbred strains are inbred stains in which a particular allele or mutation is maintained in heterozygous state. They are developed by inbreeding (usually brother x sister mating) but with heterozygosity selected at each generation. They are designated like other inbred strains since the segregating locus is part of the standard genotype of the strain (see Section 5.1 Coisogenic Strains). When segregating coat color alleles are part of the inbred strain's normal phenotype, they need not be included in the strain name (see examples below). Details of inbred strain genotypes are available in publications and databases.
Examples:

129P3/J  
This mouse strain segregates for the tyrosinase alleles albino (Tyrc) and chinchilla (Tyr c-ch).
WB/Re
This mouse strain segregates for the dominant white spotting allele of the kit oncogene (KitW).

Strains that carry linked alleles in coupling or repulsion should be designated so that it is clear that the alleles are linked and the phase of the linked genes is specified.
Examples:
B6.Cg-m Leprdb/+ +  
In this strain the m andLeprdb alleles are carried on one chromosome (in coupling) and the wild type alleles on the other.
B6.Cg-m +/+ Leprdb  
In this strain the m and Leprdb alleles are carried on different homologs of the chromosome (in repulsion); this is also called a balanced strain.

5.5   Conplastic Strains
Conplastic strains are strains in which the nuclear genome from one strain has been introduced into the cytoplasm of another, either by backcrossing (in which the mitochondrial donor is always the female parent) or by direct nuclear transfer into an enucleated zygote. The designation is NUCLEAR GENOME-mtCYTOPLASMIC GENOME.
Example:
C57BL/6J-mt BALB/c  
A strain with the nuclear genome of C57BL/6J and the cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) genome of BALB/c.

Such a strain is developed by crossing male C57BL/6J mice with BALB/c females, followed by repeated backcrossing of female offspring to male C57BL/6J. As with congenic strains, a minimum of 10 backcross generations is required, counting the F1 generation as generation 1.
6.   Outbreds and Closed Colonies
6.1   Outbreds
Outbred stocks are genetically undefined; that is, no two individuals from an outbred stock are the same. Outbreds are intentionally not bred with siblings or close relatives, as the purpose of an outbred stock is to maintain maximum heterozygosity. One advantage of using outbred stocks is lower cost, because outbreds have relatively long lifespan, are resistant to disease, and have high fecundity. They are useful for experimentation where genotype is unimportant and where a random genetic population is desired. For outbreds, the common strain root is preceded by the Laboratory Code of the institution holding the stock.
Examples:

Tac:ICR
The ICR outbred stock maintained by Taconic Farms, Inc.
Hsd:NIH Swiss  
The NIH Swiss outbred stock maintained by Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.
Hsd:J:DO   
The Diversity Outbred stock maintained by The Jackson Laboratory composed of the same original progenitor strains as the Collaborative Cross. (Churchill et al. 2012; Svenson et al. 2012)

6.2 Closed Colonies
A closed colony contains limited genetic diversity, and is maintained neither by sib-mating (inbred), nor by selective mating to maximize heterozygosity (outbred). All matings occur within the colony members, but breeders need not be selected from specific parentage. No animals are introduced into the colony from outside the stock from generation to generation.
Closed colonies may be established as a way to more readily maintain a difficult mutation, where the desire is to maintain a reasonably uniform background, but poor mating performance prohibits use of sib-mating schemes. Note that closed colonies describe a permanent mating system and this does not apply, for example, if an inbred strain is out-crossed to a near relative in a single generation because of a temporary breeding crisis.
Closed colony designations consist of the strain of origin and appropriately designated mutations (if applicable), followed by [cc] to indicate closed colony.
Example:

C57BL/6Tac-Bmp4tm1Blh[cc]  
A closed colony of mice originating from the C57BL/6Tac inbred strain and carrying the Bmp4tm1Blh targeted mutation.

7.   ES cell lines and iPS cell lines
Many ES cell lines are named by large-scale projects producing mutations based on an institution identifier and plate location. However, other ES cell lines are derived from specific existing strains or are developed as iPS cells. The naming of these cell lines should follow the convention provided below, which encapsulates the strain designation, ES Cell (or iPS cell) serial number and LabCode:
The format for the ES cell line should be:    Strain-ES#/Labcode
Example:

SC-Tg(EGFP)/Rrrc-ES1234/Kyo
   Where strain of the derived ES cell line is SC-Tg(EGFP)/Rrrc   The numbered ES cell line from the creator is ES1234   The LabCode of the ES cell line creator is Kyo

For iPS cells, the ES# would be replaced by the corresponding iPS number in the format:    Strain-iPS#/Labcode</Text>

titles that are a mere question without giving the answer;
unambitious titles, for example starting with &quot;Towards,&quot; &quot;A description of,&quot; &quot;A characterization of,&quot; &quot;Preliminary study on;&quot;
vague titles, for example starting with &quot;Role of…,&quot; &quot;Link between…,&quot; &quot;Effect of...&quot; that do not specify the role, link, or effect;
include terms that are out of place, for example the taxonomic affiliation apart from species name.
For Corrigenda, Book Reviews, General Commentaries, and Editorials, the title of your manuscript should have the following format:
&quot;Corrigendum: Title of Original Article&quot;
&quot;Book Review: Title of Book&quot;
General Commentaries
&quot;Commentary: Title of Original Article&quot;
&quot;Response: Commentary: Title of Original Article&quot;
&quot;Editorial: Title of Research Topic&quot;
The running title should be a maximum of 5 words in length.
1.9. Authors and Affiliations
All names are listed together and separated by commas. Provide exact and correct author names as these will be indexed in official archives. Affiliations should be keyed to the author's name with superscript numbers and be listed as follows: Laboratory, Institute, Department, Organization, City, State abbreviation (only for United States, Canada, and Australia), and Country (without detailed address information such as city zip codes or street names).

This section may be divided by subheadings. Footnotes should not be used and must be transferred to the main text.
DISCUSSION
This section may be divided by subheadings. Discussions should cover the key findings of the study: discuss any prior research related to the subject to place the novelty of the discovery in the appropriate context, discuss the potential shortcomings and limitations on their interpretations, discuss their integration into the current understanding of the problem and how this advances the current views, speculate on the future direction of the research, and freely postulate theories that could be tested in the future.
For further information, please check the descriptions defined in the journal’s &quot;Article Types&quot; page, which can be seen from the &quot;For Authors&quot; menu on any Frontiers journal page.
1.16. Acknowledgments
This is a short text to acknowledge the contributions of specific colleagues, institutions, or agencies that aided the efforts of the authors. Should the content of the manuscript have previously appeared online, such as in a thesis or preprint, this should be mentioned here, in addition to listing the source within the reference list.
1.17. Contribution to the Field Statement
When you submit your manuscript, you will be required to briefly summarize in 200 words your manuscript’s contribution to, and position in, the existing literature in your field. This should be written avoiding any technical language or non-standard acronyms. The aim should be to convey the meaning and importance of this research to a non-expert. While Frontiers evaluates articles using objective criteria, rather than impact or novelty, your statement should frame the question(s) you have addressed in your work in the context of the current body of knowledge, providing evidence that the findings—whether positive or negative—contribute to progress in your research discipline. This will assist the Chief Editors to determine whether your manuscript fits within the scope of a specialty as defined in its mission statement; a detailed statement will also facilitate the identification of the editors and reviewers most appropriate to evaluate your work, ultimately expediting your manuscript's initial consideration.
Example Statement on: Markram K and Markram H (2010) The Intense World Theory – a unifying theory of the neurobiology of autism. Front. Hum. Neurosci. 4:224. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224
Autism spectrum disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect up to 1 in 100 individuals. People with autism display an array of symptoms encompassing emotional processing, sociability, perception and memory, and present as uniquely as the individual. No theory has suggested a single underlying neuropathology to account for these diverse symptoms. The Intense World Theory, proposed here, describes a unifying pathology producing the wide spectrum of manifestations observed in autists. This theory focuses on the neocortex, fundamental for higher cognitive functions, and the limbic system, key for processing emotions and social signals. Drawing on discoveries in animal models and neuroimaging studies in individuals with autism, we propose how a combination of genetics, toxin exposure and/or environmental stress could produce hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity in the microcircuits involved with perception, attention, memory and emotionality. These hyper-functioning circuits will eventually come to dominate their neighbors, leading to hyper-sensitivity to incoming stimuli, over-specialization in tasks and a hyper-preference syndrome. We make the case that this theory of enhanced brain function in autism explains many of the varied past results and resolves conflicting findings and views and makes some testable experimental predictions.
2. Figure and Table Guidelines
2.1. CC-BY Licence
All figures, tables, and images will be published under a Creative Commons CC-BY licence, and permission must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including re-published/adapted/modified/partial figures and images from the internet). It is the responsibility of the authors to acquire the licenses, follow any citation instructions requested by third-party rights holders, and cover any supplementary charges.
For additional information, please see the Image Manipulation section.
2.2. Figure Requirements and Style Guidelines
Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as they are referred to in the manuscript; the figures will then be automatically embedded at the end of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order.
For figures with more than one panel, panels should be clearly indicated using labels (A), (B), (C), (D), etc. However, do not embed the part labels over any part of the image, these labels will be replaced during typesetting according to Frontiers’ journal style. For graphs, there must be a self-explanatory label (including units) along each axis.
For LaTeX files, figures should be included in the provided PDF. In case of acceptance, our Production Office might require high-resolution files of the figures included in the manuscript in EPS, JPEG or TIF/TIFF format.
In order to be able to upload more than one figure at a time, save the figures (labeled in order of appearance in the manuscript) in a zip file and upload them as ‘Supplementary Material Presentation.’
Please note that figures not in accordance with the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the production process.
2.2.1. Captions
Captions should be preceded by the appropriate label, for example &quot;Figure 1.&quot; Figure captions should be placed at the end of the manuscript. Figure panels are referred to by bold capital letters in brackets: (A), (B), (C), (D), etc.
2.2.2. Image Size and Resolution Requirements
Figures should be prepared with the PDF layout in mind. Individual figures should not be longer than one page and with a width that corresponds to 1 column (85 mm) or 2 columns (180 mm).
All images must have a resolution of 300 dpi at final size. Check the resolution of your figure by enlarging it to 150%. If the image appears blurry, jagged or has a stair-stepped effect, the resolution is too low.
The text should be legible and of high quality. The smallest visible text should be no less than 8 points in height when viewed at actual size.
Solid lines should not be broken up. Any lines in the graphic should be no smaller than 2 points wide.
Please note that saving a figure directly as an image file (JPEG, TIF) can greatly affect the resolution of your image. To avoid this, one option is to export the file as PDF, then convert into TIFF or EPS using a graphics software.
2.2.3. Format and Color Image Mode
The following formats are accepted: TIF/TIFF (.tif/.tiff), JPEG (.jpg), and EPS (.eps) (upon acceptance).
Images must be submitted in the color mode RGB.
2.2.4. Chemical Structures
Chemical structures should be prepared using ChemDraw or a similar program. If working with ChemDraw please use our Frontiers ChemDraw template. If working with another program please follow the guidelines given below:
Drawing settings: chain angle, 120° bond spacing, 18% width; fixed length, 14.4 pt; bold width, 2.0 pt; line width, 0.6 pt; margin width, 1.6 pt; hash spacing, 2.5 pt. Scale 100% Atom Label settings: font, Arial; size, 8 pt.
Assign all chemical compounds a bold, Arabic numeral in the order in which the compounds are presented in the manuscript text.
2.3. Table Requirements and Style Guidelines
Tables should be inserted at the end of the manuscript in an editable format. If you use a word processor, build your table in Word. If you use a LaTeX processor, build your table in LaTeX. An empty line should be left before and after the table.
Table captions must be placed immediately before the table. Captions should be preceded by the appropriate label, for example &quot;Table 1.&quot; Please use only a single paragraph for the caption.
Kindly ensure that each table is mentioned in the text and in numerical order.
Please note that large tables covering several pages cannot be included in the final PDF for formatting reasons. These tables will be published as supplementary material.
Please note that tables which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay during the production process.
2.4. Accessibility
Frontiers encourages authors to make the figures and visual elements of their articles accessible for the visually impaired. An effective use of color can help people with low visual acuity, or color blindness, understand all the content of an article.
These guidelines are easy to implement and are in accordance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), the standard for web accessibility best practices.
A. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and its background
People who have low visual acuity or color blindness could find it difficult to read text with low contrast background color. Try using colors that provide maximum contrast.
WC3 recommends the following contrast ratio levels:
Level AA, contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
Level AAA, contrast ratio of at least 7:1
Level AAContast ratio 4.6:1 
Level AAContast ratio 9.5:1
You can verify the contrast ratio of your palette with these online ratio checkers:
WebAIM
Color Safe
B. Avoid using red or green indicators
More than 99% of color-blind people have a red-green color vision deficiency.
C. Avoid using only color to communicate information
Elements with complex information like charts and graphs can be hard to read when only color is used to distinguish the data. Try to use other visual aspects to communicate information, such as shape, labels, and size. Incorporating patterns into the shape fills also make differences clearer; for an example please see below:
3. Supplementary Material
Data that are not of primary importance to the text, or which cannot be included in the article because they are too large or the current format does not permit it (such as videos, raw data traces, powerpoint presentations, etc.), can be uploaded as Supplementary Material during the submission procedure and will be displayed along with the published article. All supplementary files are deposited to Figshare for permanent storage and receive a DOI.
Supplementary Material is not typeset, so please ensure that all information is clearly presented without tracked changes/highlighted text/line numbers, and the appropriate caption is included in the file. To avoid discrepancies between the published article and the supplementary material, please do not add the title, author list, affiliations or correspondence in the supplementary files.
The Supplementary Material can be uploaded as Data Sheet (Word, Excel, CSV, CDX, FASTA, PDF or Zip files), Presentation (PowerPoint, PDF or Zip files), Image (CDX, EPS, JPEG, PDF, PNG or TIF/TIFF), Table (Word, Excel, CSV or PDF), Audio (MP3, WAV or WMA) or Video (AVI, DIVX, FLV, MOV, MP4, MPEG, MPG or WMV).
For Supplementary Material templates (LaTeX and Word), see our Supplementary Material templates.
4. References
All citations in the text, figures or tables must be in the reference list and vice-versa.
The names of the first six authors followed by et al. and the DOI (when available) should be provided.
The reference list should only include articles that are published or accepted.
Unpublished data, submitted manuscripts or personal communications should be cited within the text only, for the article types that allow such inclusions.
For accepted but unpublished works use &quot;in press&quot; instead of page numbers.
Data sets that have been deposited to an online repository should be included in the reference list. Include the version and unique identifier when available.
Personal communications should be documented by a letter of permission.
Website URLs should be included as footnotes.
Any inclusion of verbatim text must be contained in quotation marks and clearly reference the original source.
Preprints can be cited as long as a DOI or archive URL is available, and the citation clearly mentions that the contribution is a preprint. If a peer-reviewed journal publication for the same preprint exists, the official journal publication is the preferred source. See the Preprints section for more information.

2.3.1.10. Abstract
GUIDELINES (MAX. LIMITS)
Abstract length: 1000 words
As a primary goal, the abstract should render the general significance and conceptual advance of the work clearly accessible to a broad readership. In the abstract, minimize the use of abbreviations and do not cite references. The text of the abstract section should be in 12 point normal Times New Roman. See Summary Table for abstract requirement and length according to article type.
For Clinical Trial article types, please include the Unique Identifier and the URL of the publicly accessible website on which the trial is registered. “Experimental models of Frontotemporal Dementia-ALS spectrum disorder: a translational approach” 
Experimental design for preclinical translational research should include consideration of the genetic backgrounds, diets, bioburden, and other environmental impacts on the selected model, and early implementation of pathology to optimize specimens for analysis, and the contributions of pathology to research success.
Mice phenotypes databases:
- Mouse Phenome Database based at the Jackson Laboratory
- IMPC International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium
- The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
Phenotyping strategies: in vivo evaluations, imaging strategies, molecular evaluations (microarray, proteomics, metabolomics etc), and clinical and anatomic pathology.
Motor: rotarod, swim test, tail hang (graps limbs), 
Phenotyping variables:
In vivo phenotypes manifest at different ages, change over time, may be induced to appear or disappear, or expected phenotypes may not be evident, eye and coat color, subjective evaluation of morphology/dysmorphology, body condition, activity, and behavior; body weights for growth curves), to behavioral, metabolic, physiologic, or imaging assessments that require substantial equipment investments, to diet manipulations, and invasive interventions
Pathology might be key to assess similarities and differences between model and control
Phenotype descriptors: clinical/behavioural phenotype; gross pathological (morphological) findings; histopathology findings; genetic determinism (nature); environmental conditions (nurture)
The testing for the Late Adult pipeline starts at 52 weeks or later. An “early adult” specimen is less than 16 weeks of age, a “middle aged adult” comprises mice between 16 and 48 weeks of age, and a “late adult” is more than 48 weeks of age 
Up to 70 weeks (really old)
Consider these for project
1. What Mice do you use? Why were these selected?
2. Where do they come from? Why did you select this source?
3. What are complete names of experimental and control mice, including substrain and origin?
4. Do your experimental and control mice live together? In the same cages (e.g. littermates)? In the same rooms? In the same facilities?
5. What is their microbial status? and surveillance program?
6. What do they eat? Brand and type? Percent and type of protein? Percent and type of fat? How is it monitored for contaminants?
7. What do they sleep on (what type of bedding)? Paper? Wood?
8. Do you provide enrichment material or devices? Why or Why not?
9. What do they drink? Auto? Bottle? pH? Chlorine levels? How is it monitored for contaminants?
10. What is their light cycle? Why?
11. What are environmental noise levels and ranges? Does it matter to your study?

Immune function
Flow cytometric analysis of lymphoid organs
Subsequently, identified aberrant phenotypes attributed to the immune system can be further characterized by application of detailed hypothesis-driven analyses of lymphoid organs. We have established a series of standardized secondary examinations that comprise flow cytometric analyses of primary (bone marrow, thymus) and secondary (spleen, lymph nodes) lymphoid organs, and allow identification of a broad range of cellular parameters: T cell subsets in the thymus undergoing different maturational stages; hematopoietic stem cells, lineage progenitors and developing B cells in the bone marrow; a vast variety of sub-populations derived from lymphocytes and myeloid cells in spleen and lymph nodes. 
Immune challenge
In many cases, phenotypic screening based on the surface maker signature alone is not able to estimate the severity of the immunologic defect. Hypothesis-driven in vivo challenges, like infection with intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, provide detailed insights into the quality of innate and adaptive immune functions. Listeria has been widely used as laboratory mouse infection models with predictable response patterns. It induces an inflammatory response that substantially restricts bacterial growth and is essential for early survival of infected mice. Assessment of bacteria loads within three days after Listeria infection represent a sensitive readout for the competence of innate immunity. Competent adaptive immune system is detectable around day seven post infection. The Listeria-specific CD8+ T cells are promoted to reach peak expansion and secrete effector cytokines, which are crucial for bacterial clearance. In order to evaluate long-term protective immunity governed by T cell-mediated immune responses, mice are first immunized with a low dose of Listeria monocytogenes followed by a secondary re-challenge with a high-dose infection within the memory phase several months later. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells can be analysed in more detail via utilization of the MHC-I multimer technique. Moreover, additional characterization of effector and memory surface markers as well as cytokine production can be examined in response to re-stimulation of specific antigenic peptides.

The protein encoded by this gene plays an important role in the regulation of endosomal trafficking, and has been shown to interact with Rab proteins that are involved in autophagy and endocytic transport. Expansion of a GGGGCC repeat from 2-22 copies to 700-1600 copies in the intronic sequence between alternate 5' exons in transcripts from this gene is associated with 9p-linked ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and FTD (frontotemporal dementia) (PMID: 21944778, 21944779). Studies suggest that hexanucleotide expansions could result in the selective stabilization of repeat-containing pre-mRNA, and the accumulation of insoluble dipeptide repeat protein aggregates that could be pathogenic in FTD-ALS patients (PMID: 23393093). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

Mice
All mice were housed in pathogen-free facilities under 12-h light–dark cycles with access to food and water ad libitum. Temperatures were set to 74 ± 2 °F with humidity of 30–70%. C9orf72−/− mice were as described7 and wild-type mice were purchased from Jackson Labora-tories. C9orf72fl/fl mice were provided by the Pasterkamp laboratory12and were crossed with Cx3cr1Cre (B6J.B6N(Cg)-Cx3cr1tm1.1(cre)Jung/J) and Lyz2Cre (B6.129P2-Ly z 2tm1(cre)Ifo/J) animals, purchased from Jackson Laboratories, to obtain Cx3cr1Cre; C9orf72fl/fl and Ly z 2Cre; C9orf72fl/fl mice. STING-deficient goldenticket (STINGgt/gt) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (C57BL/6J-Tmem173gt/J). C9orf72−/− mice were crossed with STINGgt/gt mice to obtain C9orf72−/−; STINGgt/gt mice. All mice have the nuclear background of C57BL/6J mice. Mice were sex- and age-matched. For all experiments, mice were grouped according to gen-otype. For EAE and B16 melanoma models, genotypes were randomly separated into experimental groups. Researchers were blinded when scoring EAE and counting the tumour burden in the B16 melanoma model; otherwise, the investigators were not blinded to allocation dur-ing experiments and outcome assessment. Husbandry and behavioural tests were conducted in accordance with the protocols described by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s Guide for the Care and Use of Animals and were approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC number 8161). </Text>

            <Title>FTD topic - old</Title>
            <Text>The discovery that repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene has led to many exciting discoveries in the past few years. This expansion causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and is responsible for the majority of ALS and FTD cases of European ancestry. Three, not mutually exclusive pathological mechanisms have been proposed: i) Formation of RNA foci sequestering specific RNA-binding proteins and impairing their normal function; ii) Repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of RNA repeats into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) and iii) haploinsufficiency resulting in reduced levels of the C9orf72 protein contributing to pathogenesis.The pathological mechanisms of C9orf72-linked disease are a very active and timely research field and many original papers and reviews are regularly published on this subject. Therefore, the goal of this Research Topic is to address the most recent progress in unraveling molecular mechanisms of C9orf72 neurodegeneration. Furthermore, this Research Topic will highlight advances in developing translational approaches for C9orf72 disease.We will seek original research articles, reviews, and mini-reviews on the most recent aspects of the pathogenesis of C9orf72-linked disease.• RNA toxicity• Protein aggregates• Homeostasis and autophagy• Protein transport defects• Synaptopathy• Role of glia in C9orf72 neurodegeneration• Novel animal models to model C9orf72• Therapeutic approaches for C9orf72• C9orf72 neurodegeneration
Keywords: C9orf72, RNA toxicity, dipeptide-repeat, G4C2 expansion, ALS, FTD
Important Note: All contributions to this Research Topic must be within the scope of the section and journal to which they are submitted, as defined in their mission statements.

            <Title>Statistical methods</Title>
            <Synopsis>• Describe how the data will be presented in the results section (eg, mean vs median), which statistical tests will used for the inferential data, and what p value is deemed to indicate a statistically significant difference (Respir Care 2004 (49) 10 1229-1232).
• If necessary, explain why the statistical tests you selected were appropriate. Citing a reference for the appropriate statistical test is a good idea, if one is available, as it helps limit questions from the reviewers (Respir Care 2004 (49) 10 1222-1228).

• A concise guide on how to choose an appropriate statistical method is reported in: Kurichi JE, Sonnad SS. Statistical methods in the surgical literature. J Am Coll Surg 2006; 202: 476-484. 

* If you are not familiar with statistical methods, obtain the help of a statistician BEFORE starting your study, to make sure that your study methods (populations, groups, randomisation, …) are sound, to be set from the start for a great paper!

About this Research Topic
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second leading cause of young onset dementia and has a prevalence of around 3% in all dementia cases. In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the real prevalence of FTD is unknown and preliminary evidence indicates that it is likely underdiagnosed in both early and late-onset cases.FTD is a highly heritable group of neurodegenerative disorders, with around 40% of patients having a strong family history. FTD is a large umbrella, describing many phenotypes (corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, behavioral variant FTD, primary progressive aphasia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is most frequently observed, but primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is an important condition to be recognized. No direct relationship between neuropathology and clinical phenotype has been described, suggesting a complex relationship between etiopathogenic and clinical phenotypes. There is a considerable delay in diagnosis in FTD and a high rate of misdiagnosis. Barriers to diagnosis include: i) limited knowledge of FTD in LAC; ii) few validated tools for neuropsychological and speech evaluations in participants with very low education; iii) cultural factors influencing the interpretation of disorders of behavior and social cognition; iv) overlap between late-onset psychiatric disorders and bvFTD; v) the differential contribution of cognitive, behavior and motor impairment in disability.In addition to overcoming these barriers to diagnosis, individuals with FTD and their caregivers face complex needs that need to be addressed considering the socio-cultural contexts of various LAC. Addressing knowledge gaps in FTD requires consideration of the different levels of the disease from its biological basis to its impact on caregivers and society.The unique population of LAC (genetic clusters, low literacy and cognitive reserve, multilingual, multi-ethnic, high levels of inequity) presents an opportunity to understand the interplay of genetic, social, and cultural factors in the etiopathogenesis of FTD. There are critical gaps in understanding the genetic risk factors for FTD in LAC, and the role of social determinants of health (including social adversities such as exposure to violence, restricted access to health resources) as they relate to FTD presentation. It is also unclear if the high prevalence of under-treated vascular risk factors are associated with a higher prevalence or earlier onset of FTD in LAC, and if previous psychiatric disorders are associated with FTD in these particular settings in LAC.The aim of this Research Topic is to bring together research addressing FTD in LAC from various specialties (neurologist, psychiatric, geriatric) and subspecialties (cognitive neurology, movement disorder, neuropsychiatric), and a broad range of disciplines from basic science to social science. In doing so, this collection will describe current state-of-the-art practices in FTD diagnosis in LAC and will identify challenges for future research.Topics for this collection aim to include, but are not limited to:i) Introduction aiming to present FTD to a non-specialist and specialist audience and describing a multilevel or pluralistic approach to studying FTDii) Historical perspective on FTD in LACiii) Basics of FTD (genetics, pathophysiology, pathology, translational research)iv) Biomarkers (neuroimaging: MRI, DTI, molecular neuroimaging- PET; CSF)v) Clinical aspects (epidemiology, diagnostics, cognitive and neuropsychiatry studies, evaluation, language)vi) Caregiver (burden, morbidities, educational programs) and health systemvii) FTD and COVID-19viii) Multidisciplinary and cross-cultural studies, for example, social cognition and culture, or the importance of social context in the diagnosis of dementia.We would like to acknowledge that Drs. Adolfo Garcia, Diana Matallana, José Alberto Avila Funes, Leonel Takada, Maria Isabel Behrens, and Nilton Custodio, have acted as coordinators and have contributed to the preparation of the proposal for this Research Topic.

            <Text>I'm using Zotero with Better BibTex plugin as my reference manager, and have installed the zotpick applescript Application, which works fine.I compile my document to plain text.I've installed Pandoc and various filters (citeproc, fignos, eqnos etc), and have a simple Pandoc command that converts the plain text to PDF.I still have to get to grips with styles, but I've done quite a lot of webpage/css development so hope it is relatively straightforward.I have 2 things that I need to get working though: figures and equations. I'm a bit confused by the Scrivener/Pandoc images documentation. I've tried using 'Image linked from File', the image appears in the document but it doesn't appear in my PDF. How do I get it to appear in the PDF?For figures - I'm going to have a lot, this is a science PhD thesis, so the figures are the most important part. I'd like to have a link to an external file, so if I change them (they are produced using Python), the figure in the document is automatically updated. I also need to be able to reference them within the text, and have that reference update automatically if the order of figures changes (i.e. Fig 2 changes to Fig. 3). I can do this with LaTeX, can I do it in Scrivener? Also, can I edit the size of images using Markdown </Text>

Each marker is separated into five sections, separated by vertical lines (pipes). The first section may contain a citation prefix. The second section contains the authors (or title) and year of the cited item; this section only exists to show you which item is cited by the citation marker. The third section may contain a locator, such as a page number. The fourth section may contain a citation suffix. Finally, the fifth section contains a unique item identifier (consisting of a user/group ID and an item ID).
You are free to change the first four sections, but be careful to never modify the identifier section. If we add a citation prefix, locator, and suffix to the above marker, we get:
{See | Smith, (2012) |p. 45 | for an example |zu:2433:WQVBH98K}
will can later be turned into, with e.g. the APA citation style:
(See Smith, 2012, p. 45 for an example)
Formatting Prefixes and Suffixes
Text in citation prefixes and suffixes can be formatted in italics with single asterisks on either side (e.g. *Weltanschauung*), or in bold with double asterisks (e.g. **strongly**).
Suppress Author
You can suppress the author in the active Zotero citation by putting a minus sign (-) at the start of the second section of the citation marker.
{ |-Smith, (2012) | | |zu:2433:WQVBH98K}
This allows you to write &quot;Smith (2012)&quot; (where you write &quot;Smith &quot; by hand, and &quot;(2012)&quot; represents the Zotero citation).
Locators
The following locator labels are automatically recognized and reformatted according to the citation style and locale selected in Zotero. Note that you must included a space between locator label and number (e.g. ch. 6 instead of ch.6).

            <Text>Resumo e abstract

CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO DA PROBLEMÁTICA*
Instruções de Preenchimento: Neste campo deverá ser descrito e contextualizado, preferencialmente de forma sucinta, o estado da arte do problema de saúde objeto da pesquisa. Para tanto, espera-se que este campo contenha dados sobre: (a) a fisiopatologia, epidemiologia, carga de doença e o impacto do problema para os sistemas de saúde, no mundo e no Brasil; e (b) o estado da arte das pesquisas sobre os tratamentos, farmacológicos e não-farmacológicos, disponíveis e emergentes para o problema de saúde objeto da pesquisa, bem como suas lacunas. Recomenda-se que este campo seja separado em seções, com vistas a traçar uma linha lógica e sistematizada de pensamento. 

Características clínicas: A esclerose lateral amiotrófica é descrita como uma doença neuromuscular, degenerativa e incurável, que afeta os neurônios motores superiores e inferiores. É uma das principais doenças neurodegenerativas, juntamente com a Doença de Alzheimer e Doença de Parkinson. 
Fisiopatologia: A principal característica patológica da ELA é a morte neuronal no córtex motor e medula espinhal, e a doença ocorre de forma esporádica e de forma ainda desconhecida em cerca de 90% dos pacientes. A degeneração dos neurônios motores é acompanhada de processos neuroinflamatórios, com proliferação da astroglia, microglia e oligodendrócitos; bem como a agregação de proteínas citoplasmáticas, como TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) e superóxido dismutase (SOD1). Astrócitos ativados e em proliferação podem não fornecer mais suporte metabólico aos neurônios motores e também se tornar neurotóxicos pela secreção de citocinas que são críticos para determinar a taxa de progressão da doença (Fim et al., 2008; Ferraiuolo et al., 2011). Assim como, microglia ativada e  acompanhada por elevadas concentrações de citocinas pró-inflamatórias no cérebro, sangue e líquido cefalorraquidiano (Morello et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2017; Crisafulli et al., 2018, Hu et al., 2017, Evans et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2009, Yasojima et al., 2001 , Yiangou et al., 2006). Esses fatores vão se somando em etapas de danos moleculares até causarem uma lesão celular irreversível . As causas da ELA são apenas parcialmente conhecidas, incluindo alguns fatores ambientais e mais de 30 genes que são responsáveis pelas distintas apresentações clínicas. Cerca de 10% dos indivíduos com ELA apresentam  mutações em genes como C9orf72, SOD1 e TARDPBs. Vesículas extracelulares e seus componentes, portanto, representam uma nova classe tanto de biomarcadores quanto de alvos terapêuticos para doenças neurodegenerativas. Dados recentes indicam que as VEs podem ser exploradas diretamente como potenciais agentes terapêuticos para regeneração de tecidos e modulação da resposta imune (Andaloussi et al 2013). Vários estudos vêm demonstrando os efeitos terapêuticos de VEs derivados de células-tronco mesenquimais, para o tratamento de uma variedade de condições neurológicas e doenças neurodegenerativas. Os efeitos benéficos de VEs derivadas de CTMs foram observados em modelos animais de lesão cerebral  traumática (TBI), acidente vascular cerebral ou isquemia , epilepsia , esclerose múltipla, doença de Alzheimer e lesão da medula espinhal (Lu Y et al 2019). Além disso, os efeitos terapêuticos no tratamento da ELA foram observados in vitro. Um estudo demonstrou que VEs derivadas de células estromais de tecido adiposo apresentaram um efeito protetor em células NSC-34 que expressam mutações de ALS contra danos de estresse oxidativo. Adicionalmente, outro estudo evidenciou que as VEs reduziram a SOD1 citosólica e melhoraram disfunções mitocondriais . Esses dados promissores trazem esperança para o futuro, mas destacam a necessidade de investigações mais profundas do papel terapêutico das VEs em doenças neurodegenerativas como a ELA. 
Epidemiologia: A ELA é a doença neurodegenerativa mais comum na idade adulta, com início em torno dos 50 anos. A incidência de ELA é de cerca de 1 a 3 casos por ano para cada 100.000 pessoas, e dados locais apontam uma prevalência de 5 casos a cada 100.000 pessoas, o que leva a uma estimativa de prevalência de mais de 10.000 brasileiros com a doença. A incidência e prevalência da doença aumentam com a idade, e dados europeus e norte-americanos estimam um risco cumulativo de 1:400 de desenvolver a enfermidade. Estima-se que, apenas nos Estados Unidos, cerca de 800.000 pessoas que hoje estão vivas, venham a falecer de ELA. Na forma esporádica da doença, os homens são afetados em um proporção de 2:1 em relação às mulheres, e nos quadros familiares, essa taxa é próxima de 1:1. Além disso, há muito se sabe que o envolvimento não é exclusivamente motor, havendo, especialmente, envolvimento cognitivo em até 50% dos pacientes e demência definida em 5-15% dos casos . A doença é um pouco mais prevalente em homens e pode iniciar clinicamente em qualquer idade, sendo mais comum entre os 58-63 anos nos casos esporádicos e entre os 47-52 nos familiares e as apresentações clínicas são variáveis, no entanto a sobrevida ainda é baixa na maior parte delas, sendo que 50% dos pacientes morrem em até 30 meses do aparecimento dos sintomas. 
Carga de doença: A enfermidade apresenta grande impacto funcional, sendo que os dados de 2016 apontam um prejuízo de 926090 anos de vida ajustados decorrentes da enfermidade, tornando o problema mais amplo do que apenas em relação ao sistema de saúde, mas também com grande impacto previdenciário e de necessidade de cuidados de suporte em tempo integral. Dados globais de 2016 indicam que mais de 330.000 pessoas apresentavam doença do neurônio motor, tendo ocorrido 34235 mortes neste período (GBD 2016). 
Tratamento não farmacológico: Apesar de ainda ter uma evolução desfavorável, a sobrevida tem aumentado nos últimos anos, tendo passado de 29 meses em média para os indivíduos diagnosticados antes do ano 2000, para 36 meses naqueles em que a doença foi definida entre 2000-2009.  Além disso, cerca de 10% dos pacientes sobrevivem mais de 8 anos. Para que o aumento da sobrevida aconteça, contudo, há a necessidade de uma equipe multidisciplinar extensa, além de múltiplos tratamentos medicamentosos. É importante lembrar que apesar de incurável a doença não é intratável, necessitando de diversas medidas para prolongar não só a vida do paciente, mas também a qualidade da mesma. As principais medidas terapêuticas para os pacientes com ELA são focadas em sintomas, como prevenção de aspiração, ventilação não invasiva e alimentação por via enteral. Em relação aos sintomas cognitivos decorrentes da enfermidade, não existe hoje terapia farmacológica específica, utilizando-se medicações com efeitos sintomáticos para manifestações como agressividade, compulsão ou apatia; incluindo anti-psicóticos e inibidores da recaptação de serotonina (CONITEC PDCT ELA, 2019).
Tratamento farmacológico: A maior dificuldade, em relação ao tratamento farmacológico, porém, é a falta de um entendimento pleno da fisiopatologia da doença. Mais de 50 moléculas com atuação em diferentes mecanismos já foram estudadas para o tratamento da ELA, porém apenas dois medicamentos foram aprovados para tratamento da doença: Riluzole, o qual postula-se que inibe o excesso glutamatérgico nos canais de sódio voltagem-dependentes nos neurônios pré-sinápticos; e o Edaravone, o qual reduz o estresse oxidativo. Ambos os medicamentos contribuem para um aumento limitado da expectativa de vida dos pacientes - o Riluzole aumentou a sobrevida em 3 meses, porém sem efeito curativo ou neuroprotetor a longo prazo. O Protocolo Clínico e Diretrizes Terapêuticas dessa doença, publicado por meio da Portaria MS no. 1.151/2015, propõe como medida farmacológica o uso do fármaco RILUZOL.,que pode determinar  leve melhora dos sintomas bulbares e da função dos membros e aumento da sobrevida. Portanto sem efeito curativo. Este medicamento é fornecido pelo SUS por meio do Componente Especializado da Assistência Farmacêutica (CEAF) sendo dispensado nas farmácias das Superintendências Estaduais de Saúde aos pacientes com diagnóstico comprovado de ELA. Foi analisado um ensaio clínico randomizado que avaliou o edaravone em pacientes com esclerose lateral amiotrófica, comparado com placebo. Tanto o desfecho primário quanto os parâmetros secundários não apresentaram diferenças estatisticamente significantes entre os grupos placebo e edaravone. A frequência dos eventos adversos foi elevada e semelhante entre os grupos placebo e edaravone.  Ocorreram cinco óbitos durante o estudo, sendo dois no grupo placebo e três no grupo edaravone, relacionados com desordem ou insuficiência respiratória. A eficácia do edaravone para o tratamento da ELA não foi demonstrada neste ensaio clínico. Os pacientes em uso de riluzol neste estudo não alteraram esta conduta durante a pesquisa. Os  resultados negativos da maioria dos fármacos estudados podem estar associados à heterogeneidade clínica e patológica da enfermidade, bem como limitações nos desenhos dos estudos e identificação dos pacientes em fase precoce. O advento de novas terapias, com potencial curativo ou modificador da doença, envolve o possível desenvolvimento de biomarcadores de genômica, proteômica e metabolômica a nível nanocelular, buscando possíveis terapias combinadas voltadas a processos inflamatórios e de acúmulo de citoplasmático de proteínas; idealmente prescritas de forma individualizada, como forma de melhor abordagem de um processo notoriamente heterogêneo e com diferentes estágios clínico-patológicos. Assim, é desejável mudança de paradigma que introduza terapia inovadora radical para avançarmos no tratamento efetivo da ELA. A presente proposta insere-se nesta perspectiva, com o transplante de vesículas extracelulares (VEs) no tratamento da esclerose lateral amiotrófica.
Estado da arte da terapia celular: Ensaios clínicos
Vesículas Extracelulares: Vesículas Extracelulares (VEs) são nanopartículas secretadas por diversos tipos de células, e possuem um papel chave e de destaque na comunicação celular em diferentes estados fisiológicos. Como mediadores de comunicação e sinalização celular estas são capazes de atuar no metabolismo celular ou tecidual em pontos locais ou de maneira sistêmica no organismo. As VEs carregam proteínas, miRNA’s, RNA’s, mRNA’s, entre outros componentes, os quais podem fornecer informações acerca dos estados fisiológicos de suas células parentais. As VEs e seus componentes, portanto, representam uma nova classe tanto de biomarcadores quanto de alvos terapêuticos para doenças neurodegenerativas. Dados recentes indicam que as VEs podem ser exploradas diretamente como potenciais agentes terapêuticos para regeneração de tecidos e modulação da resposta imune e inflamatória (Andaloussi et al 2013). Vários estudos vêm demonstrando os efeitos terapêuticos de VEs derivados de células-tronco mesenquimais, para o tratamento de uma variedade de condições neurológicas e doenças neurodegenerativas. Esses dados promissores, realçam o papel essencial que estas partículas desempenham como carreadoras de substâncias e destacam a necessidade de investigações mais profundas do papel terapêutico das VEs em doenças neurodegenerativas como a ELA.

Sistemas de biorrepositório e biobanco: Os biobancos são reservatórios de longa duração, cujos materiais armazenados podem ser utilizados em várias pesquisas, e ficam sob responsabilidade da instituição. O Biobanco PUCRS (BBPUCRS) é uma coleção organizada de amostras e dados humanos que têm potencial para ser ofertada em diferentes pesquisas. O BBPUCRS segue as normas técnicas, éticas e operacionais nacionais, e foi autorizado para funcionar sob responsabilidade e gerenciamento da PUCRS, e sem fins comerciais. Na composição do BBPUCRS, o InsCer busca consolidar a Coleção Especializada do Instituto do Cérebro do Rio Grande do Sul (InsCer) que permitirá a realização de pesquisas que ajudam a entender vários aspectos das doenças neurológicas, como causas, sintomas, evolução e tratamentos. Dentro deste intento, buscamos através desta proposta a aproximação de todo conhecimento em terapia celular cunhado pelo grupo com uma nova estratégia terapêutica para o tratamento da ELA com grande capacidade e uso em uma plataforma de oferta terapêutica contínua em um sistema sistematizado de armazenamento e distribuição de bioinsumos.

Materiais e métodos
Este projeto será desenvolvido no Laboratório de Neurociências, Centro de Terapia Celular, Centro de Pesquisa Pré-Clínica (CPPC) e Laboratório de Nanomedicina e Vesículas Extracelulares (Nanomedicine and Extracellular Vesicles Laboratory) do Instituto do Cérebro do Rio Grande do Sul (InsCer), em parceria com o Instituto Carlos Chagas/Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) do Paraná e Institute for Regenerative Medicine da Texas A&amp;M University. 
Este projeto é composto por dois seguimentos: Estudo in vitro e estudo in vivo
3.2.2 ANIMAIS 
Serão utilizados camundongos transgênicos, da linhagem B6SJL-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J, que superexpressam SOD1 humana com a mutação Gly93→Ala (Gurney et al. 1994). O transgene SOD1G93A foi desenhado a partir de um gene mutante humano da SOD1 que possui uma única substituição de aminoácido: glicina por alanina no códon 93. Os animais transgênicos SOD1G93A são considerados um bom modelo para o estudo da ELA, e têm sido extensivamente utilizados em investigações de mecanismos patofisiológicos, bem como em estudos que avaliam alternativas terapêuticas para o tratamento da doença. Neste modelo, ocorre degeneração progressiva de neurônios motores do corno ventral da medula espinhal, levando à fraqueza progressiva e sobrevida limitada, com sintomas fenotípicos e patológicos que se assemelham à ELA em humanos (Gurney et al. 1994; Fischer et al. 2004). A análise patológica desses animais também demonstra haver vacuolização mitocondrial, fragmentação do aparelho de Golgi, inclusões de neurofilamentos e agregados SOD1-reativos, além de astrocitose e microgliose (revisado por (Turner e Talbot 2008)). Os sintomas são progressivos e os animais têm uma vida média de 17-20 semanas (Weydt et al. 2003). Para  a obtenção de CTM e VEs serão utilizados animais B6SJL-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J e Wild-type SOD1 (Tg (SOD1)2Gur (animais controle que carregam o alelo normal do gene humano SOD1).
Os animais serão adquiridos do laboratório Jackson (Bar Harbor, Maine, EUA), e serão mantidos em quarentena, da qual serão liberados  após testes de controle de patógenos. Os mesmos testes serão repetidos rotineiramente para assegurar a qualidade e a manutenção de animais livres de patógenos. A colônia será mantida no Centro de Modelos Biológicos Experimentais da PUCRS (CeMBE) através do acasalamento de portadores heterozigotos machos com fêmeas híbridas B6SLJ. As atividades do CeMBE são orientadas pela Comissão de Ética no Uso de Animais (CEUA) que estabelece parâmetros para uma utilização eticamente adequada de animais não humanos no âmbito da nossa Instituição. Os animais transgênicos serão genotipados e o número de cópias do transgene será determinado pela técnica de PCR a partir de DNA obtido do sangue da cauda. Os animais serão mantidos sob iluminação e temperatura controladas (ciclo claro-escuro de 12 horas e aproximadamente 24ºC), com livre acesso à comida e à água. Será adicionada ração dentro da gaiola dos camundongos transgênicos SOD1G93A a partir de sua 15ª semana de vida. A eutanásia será realizada por overdose de isoflurano. 	

3.2.1 VESÍCULAS EXTRACELULARES (VEs)
As Vesículas Extracelulares (VEs) são nanopartículas secretadas por diversos tipos de células, e possuem um papel chave e de destaque na comunicação celular em diferentes estados fisiológicos (Keller S et al 2006;  Li P et al 2017). Como mediadores de comunicação e sinalização celular estas são capazes de atuar no metabolismo celular ou tecidual em pontos locais ou de maneira sistêmica no organismo (Phinney D et al 2017). As VEs carregam proteínas, miRNA’s, RNA’s, mRNA’s, entre outros componentes, os quais podem fornecer informações acerca dos estados fisiológicos de suas células parentais (Levy E et al 2017; Li P et al 2017). Destaca-se como função atribuída a estas estruturas celulares a capacidade de comunicação (Jella K et al 2018), servindo assim como mensageiros intercelulares distantes ou próximos (Mathivanan S et al 2010). Atualmente três subtipos de vesículas são definidos (Gould SJ et al 2013): microvesículas, exossomas e corpos apoptóticos. Diversos estudos já demonstraram o potencial terapêutico das VEs em diversas neuropatologias. Na presente proposta, as VEs serão utilizadas como uma alternativa terapêutica para o tratamento da ELA. As VEs serão isoladas de CTMs da medula óssea de camundongos transgênicos SOD1 e WT-SOD e serão transplantadas via intravenosa (veia da cauda) dos animais transgênicos SOD1.
Os principais mecanismos de ação das VEs estão associados com a regulação da neuroinflamação, contribuindo para a plasticidade sináptica, para a neurotransmissão e para a modulação fenotípica (Van Niel et al 2006). Além disso, com a regulação da resposta imune, a partir da ativação da resposta adaptativa; ou da supressão da inflamação (Raposo, G et al 2013). Os efeitos terapêuticos no tratamento da ELA foram observados apenas em modelo in vitro, demonstrando que as VEs isoladas de células estromais de tecido adiposo apresentaram um efeito protetor contra danos de estresse oxidativo e disfunções mitocondriais (Bonafede et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016).

3.2.3. DELINEAMENTO EXPERIMENTAL 
Para este estudo, o mesmo número de camundongos machos e fêmeas será distribuído entre os grupos experimentais para minimizar o efeito sistêmico relacionado ao gênero na resposta ao tratamento (Stam et al 2008). Também serão estabelecidos dois tempos distintos para intervenção: os animais serão alocados em um grupo considerado assintomático (70 dias de vida) e outro sintomático (110 dias de vida), uma vez que neste modelo o aparecimento dos primeiros sintomas ocorre em torno do 90º dia de vida (Gurney et al. 1994). Adicionalmente, serão testadas VEs de origens diferentes: obtidas de camundongos wild-type não portadores da mutação ou de camundongos transgênicos SOD1G93A. Assim, os animais serão distribuídos randomicamente nos grupos abaixo:	
Grupo WTVEs-70-SOD1: camundongos SOD1G93A transplantados com  70 dias (pré-sintomático) com VEs do camundongo WT-SOD1 (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas).
Grupo mSOD1VEs-70-SOD1: camundongos SOD1G93A transplantados aos  70 dias (pré -sintomático ) com  VEs dos camundongos  SOD1G93A (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas).
Grupo WTVEs-110-SOD1: camundongos SOD1G93A transplantados com  110 dias   (sintomático tardio) com  VEs do camundongo WT-SOD1  (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas). 
Grupo  mSOD1VEs-110-SOD1: camundongos SOD1G93A transplantados com  110 dias   (sintomático tardio) com  VEs do camundongo  SOD1G93A (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas).
Grupo  SAL-SOD1 : camundongos SOD1G93A tratados com salina  (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas). 
Grupo SAL-C57BL6: camundongos WT-SOD1  tratados com salina  (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas). 
Grupo WTVEs-CTL: camundongos WT-SOD1 transplantados com VEs de camundongos WT   (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas). 
Grupo mSOD1VEs-CTL: camundongos WT-SOD1 transplantados com VEs de camundongos SOD1G93A   (n = 30, sendo n=15 machos e n=15 fêmeas). 
Uma coorte adicional de camundongos (n=5 por grupo de estudo) será tratada conforme previamente descrito, mas será eutanasiada aos 120 dias de vida para análise histológica. Após a eutanásia, será computada a sobrevida dos animais e coletadas amostras teciduais. O estudo será delineado de maneira que os animais da mesma ninhada sejam distribuídos igualmente entre os grupos. Todos os procedimentos serão realizados por observadores cegos ao tratamento recebido pelos animais.
Além disso, serão utilizados 20 animais SOD1G93A   e 20 animais WT-SOD1 para compor o grupo de doadores de células mononucleares da medula óssea para cultura e expansão de células-tronco mesenquimais e para as culturas primárias de astrócitos da medula espinhal para os ensaios in vitro. 

3.3 OBTENÇÃO DAS CÉLULAS MONONUCLEARES DA MEDULA ÓSSEA 
Para a obtenção das células mononucleares da medula óssea (CMMO), camundongos wild-type não portadores da mutação (WT-SOD1) e camundongos transgênicos SOD1G93A (n = 20), serão anestesiados e dissecados e a medula óssea de ossos longos (úmero, fêmur e tíbia) será aspirada com o auxílio de uma agulha de 26G contendo heparina (10.000 U em 50 mL de PBS). O material será centrifugado a 400 × g por 10 minutos. As células serão ressuspensas em meio RPMI-1640 e fracionadas em gradiente de densidade gerado pela centrifugação a 400 × g em uma solução de Ficoll-Paque. A camada mononuclear formada sobre o FicollPaque será coletada e lavada com DPBS. As concentrações celulares serão determinadas em câmara de Neubauer e a viabilidade celular será determinada pelo método de exclusão com azul de tripan. As células serão ressuspendidas em DMEM com 10% FBS e 10 mM HEPES (Costa-Ferro et al., 2010, Venturin et al. 2011., Costa-Ferro et al 2012., Zanirati et al., 2015). Posteriormente, as populações celulares presentes serão caracterizadas pela detecção de antígenos de superfície e analisadas por um citômetro de fluxo FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, USA). 
3.3.1 Cultura das Células-Tronco Mesenquimais (CTM)
A fração mononuclear será colocada em cultura em meio DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) suplementado com L-glutamina, 10% de soro fetal bovino, 100 U/mL de penicilina, 100 U/mL de estreptomicina e 100 µg/mL de gentamicina, com densidade de 107 células por frasco. A cultura será mantida em estufa úmida a 37°C com 5% CO2 por seis dias.
Quando as células em cultivo atingirem confluência de aproximadamente 80% será realizada a passagem para um recipiente maior de cultura. O meio de cultura será removido e as células mesenquimais devem permanecer aderidas ao frasco. Essas células serão lavadas com DPBS e incubadas com 5 mL de Tripsina/EDTA (0,5%) (Invitrogen Inc, USA), a 37ºC por aproximadamente 5 minutos. Um volume igual de meio DMEM será adicionado para neutralizar a ação da tripsina. As células serão centrifugadas a 400 x g por 5 minutos e o sobrenadante será descartado. As células serão ressuspensas com DMEM suplementado e transferidas para garrafas de 75 cm2. As células serão cultivadas até a 5º passagem e serão então encaminhados para o protocolo de obtenção e isolamento das vesículas extracelulares.
3.3.2 Caracterização das CTMs 
As células mesenquimais provenientes da medula óssea de camundongos com mutação para SOD1G93A e não portadores da mutação (WT-SOD1) serão caracterizadas pela expressão de antígenos específicos a partir da quarta passagem. As células serão avaliadas por citometria de fluxo com os seguintes anticorpos: CD19, CD45, CD117, Sca-1, CD34 na concentração de um 1:10 em PBS. As células serão incubadas com os anticorpos a 5°C no escuro por pelo menos 15 minutos, as células serão lavadas com PBS e centrifugadas a 1.500 rpm por 5 minutos e o sobrenadante será descartado. As células serão ressuspensas com 1 mL de paraformaldeído 4% e seguirão para análise em citômetro de fluxo. As amostras serão analisadas em um citômetro de fluxo FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, USA). Os dados obtidos corresponderão a pelo menos 50.000 eventos.
Isolamento das Vesículas Extracelulares (VEs)
		Para o isolamento das VEs, as CTMs serão cultivadas em soro fetal bovino depletado (dSFB) para que não haja contaminação das vesículas existentes no soro. Posteriormente, o meio de cultura será substituído por meio DMEM suplementado com 2% de dSFB com antibióticos. O sobrenadante será então coletado e para a extração das vesículas extracelulares será utilizado o kit ExoQucick-TC ULTRA for Tissue Culture Media (System Biosciences). O kit consta em três etapas: Isolamento, purificação e eluição das VEs. Para a primeira etapa de isolamento, as CTMs serão centrifugadas a 3.000 × g por 15 minutos para remover os resíduos celulares. Após, o sobrenadante será transferido para um novo tubo e será adicionado o volume apropriado de tampão ExoQuick-TC de acordo com o volume de sobrenadante obtido (5mL de sobrenadante = 1mL de tampão) e deverá ser misturado por inversão. Após, será incubado overnight (ou pelo menos 12 horas) à 4°C. Após incubação, a amostra será centrifugada a 3.000 × g por 10 minutos. Após, o pellet contendo as VEs deverá ser ressuspendido em 200 µl de tampão B e a concentração proteica da amostra será registrada. Para a purificação das VEs isoladas, será adicionado 200 µl de tampão A. Após, uma coluna de purificação será acoplada a um tubo de coleta e será centrifugada a 1.000 x g por 30s para remoção do tampão de armazenamento. Após, a coluna será lavada com 500 µl de Tampão B e centrifugada a 1.000 x g por 30s. A lavagem da coluna deverá ser repetida mais uma vez. Após, será adicionado 100 µl de tampão B e a amostra será transferida para a coluna. A amostra será homogeneizada à temperatura ambiente em um agitador por 5 minutos. Para a etapa final de eluição, a amostra será transferida da coluna para um tubo de coleta de 2mL e será centrifugada a 1.000 x g por 30s para a obtenção das VEs purificadas. As VEs isoladas serão ressuspendidas em tampão fosfato salina (PBS). As VEs isoladas são nanopartículas estáveis e poderão ser imediatamente utilizadas nas análises previstas no presente projeto ou armazenadas no Biobanco do InsCer a uma temperatura de -80°C para uso posterior (Leitolis, Suss et al., 2019).

Caracterização da VEs
	Para tal, após a extração das vesículas extracelulares, alíquotas serão preparadas para realização de Microscopia Eletrônica de Transmissão (MET) para analisar a morfologia das vesículas contidas nas amostras. Este protocolo consiste em fixar 5uL de VEs em discos fabricados de níquel com uma película de formivar de cobertura. Após, serão dispostas em PFA 4% e pós-fixadas em glutaraldeído e tampão cacodilato durante 10 minutos. Posteriormente, os discos de níquel serão lavados com água ultrapura e então dispostos juntamente a acetato de uranila para visualização. Também, será utilizado o equipamento de rastreamento de nanopartículas NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical) para identificar a quantidade e o tamanho das VEs. Além disso, a quantidade total de proteínas será mensurada com o auxílio do fluorômetro Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) baseado em curvas proteicas já conhecidas disponibilizadas pelo fabricante (Leitolis et al 2019). 
Marcação das VEs 
	Para o acompanhamento da migração das VEs no tecido alvo, estas serão marcadas com o corante de membrana PKH26 (MINI26; Sigma-Aldrich, USA).  As VEs serão transferidas de PBS para o diluente C (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) e centrifugados a 110.000 × g durante 70 min. O PKH26 será diluído a 4 mM, e as VEs (200 μg / mL), seguido da adição de 5% de BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) serão lavados por centrifugação. O pellet de VEs será suspenso em 0,5 mL de PBS. Para evitar agregados, as VEs serão filtradas através de uma seringa de 0,2 μm imediatamente antes da utilização. 
Perfil de miRNAs das VEs 
Para a análise do perfil inflamatório dos miRNAs contidos nas VEs derivados das CTM da MO, será realizada a extração de miRNAs utilizando kit ReliaPrep miRNA Cell and Tissue Miniprep System (Promega) conforme orientação do fabricante. 
A avaliação dos níveis de miRNAs envolvidos na resposta inflamatória  será analisada através de ensaios de arranjos moleculares utilizando o kit miScript miRNA PCR Array Mouse Inflammatory Response &amp; Autoimmunity (Qiagen) composto por 84 alvos de miRNAs que regulam a expressão de genes pró e anti-inflamatórios.

3.1 ESTUDO IN VITRO: TRANSFERÊNCIA DE VEs ENTRE CÉLULAS EM CULTIVO 
Será realizada cultura primária de astrócitos da medula espinhal de camundongos recém-nascidos transgênicos SOD1G93A e não portadores da mutação (WT-SOD1). Os animais recém-nascidos (0-12h) serão anestesiados e eutanasiados por decapitação. Será realizada a exposição da medula espinhal através da retirada da pele e músculos posteriores. Serão seccionadas as raízes dorsais e ventrais para remoção das porções cervicais, média e lombar da medula espinhal. As amostras serão rapidamente colocadas em uma solução salina 0,9% refrigerada (4°C). O tecido será dissociado manualmente e meio DMEM e filtrado a uma porosidade de 75 µm. A conteúdo será centrifugado a 400 g por 5 minutos, o sobrenadante será removido e as células precipitadas serão ressuspendidas em meio DMEM suplementado com 5% de soro fetal bovino, 100 U/mL de penicilina, 100 U/mL de estreptomicina, 100 μg/mL de gentamicina. As células serão cultivadas em lamínulas de vidro previamente tratadas com pré-cobertura. As lamínulas serão transferidas individualmente para placas de seis poços e cultivadas por 10 dias sob condições de 5% CO2 e 37°C.
Para avaliação do potencial neuroprotetor das VEs derivadas de CTM, as células serão expostas a duas diferentes concentrações de H2O2 (50 µM e 100 µM) e duas concentrações de VEs (0,2 mg/ml e 0,4 mg/ml) por 2h, 6h 12h e 24h. Será realizado ensaio Triplex (Promega) para avaliação da citotoxicidade, viabilidade e apoptose. Após cada tempo de exposição, as células serão cultivadas em uma placa aderente de 96 poços em sistema de triplicata. Será adicionado às células 20 μL de solução para quantificação da viabilidade e citotoxicidade com os substratos cell permeable glycylphenylalanyl-aminofluoroumarin/GF-AFC e bis-alanyl-alanyl phenylalanyl-rhodamine 110/bis-AAF-R110. As células ficarão sob agitação orbital a 300 rpm/30 seg, seguido de uma incubação de 30 min a 37°C. Será realizada uma leitura utilizando o parâmetro fluorescência nos comprimentos de onda de excitação e emissão de 400 e 505 nm para viabilidade e 485 e 520 nm para citotoxicidade. Após, será adicionado as células o reagente Caspase-Glo® 3/7 e realizada leitura por luminescência para avaliação do potencial de apoptose.
Para avaliar a capacidade de comunicação parácrina, VEs derivadas de CTM de animais transgênicos SOD1G93A e animais não portadores da mutação (WT-SOD1) marcadas com PKH26 serão adicionadas a culturas primárias de astrócitos da medula espinhal de camundongos SOD1G93A e WT-SOD1. As VEs serão adicionadas separadamente as culturas primárias de astrócitos nas concentrações de 0,2 mg/ml e 0,4 mg/ml por 2h, 6h 12h e 24h de cultivo.
Será realizada avaliação da invaginação das VEs nos astrócitos derivados da medula espinhal. Após cada período, as culturas serão lavadas com solução tampão DBPS e fixadas com paraformaldeído 4% por 10 minutos. Será adicionado o intercalante nuclear DAPI para contracoloração. As VEs serão rastreadas através da excitação do marcador PKH26 utilizando microscópio confocal ZEEIS LSM5 aplicando comprimento de onda de 550 nm. Para a marcação nuclear será utilizado comprimento de onda de 405 nm.
Para analisar uma possível modulação das culturas primárias de astrócitos mediada pelo contato com as VEs, após a cada período de exposição, as células serão tripsinizadas e será realizada análise molecular conforme descrito no item XXXX desta proposta. 

3.3 Análise do proteoma dos astrócitos em contato com as vesículas extracelulares derivadas de CTMs
Para análise do conteúdo proteico das células em diferentes condições, 30 μg de proteína serão utilizadas para cada amostra. Inicialmente as amostras de células lavadas e centrifugadas serão tratadas com tampão de lise (SDS 30%, DTT 1M, Tris HCl 1M pH 7,5) na proporção de 1:1 (v/v) por 15 minutos a temperatura de 94ºC, sendo que a cada 5 minutos as amostras serão agitadas vigorosamente. Em seguida, as amostras serão submetidas ao sonicador por 30 min, permitindo assim a liberação do conteúdo proteico total. As amostras serão centrifugadas a 16.000 x g por 5 minutos e o sobrenadante passado para um novo tubo. Será acrescentado tampão de amostra na proporção 1:4 (v/v) e incubadas por mais 2 minutos a 94ºC. Posteriormente, as proteínas presentes nas amostras serão resolvidas através de eletroforese de proteínas em gel SDS-PAGE (poliacrilamida 10%), submetidas a uma corrente elétrica de 30 mA e uma voltagem de 190V.
Gel corados com solução de Comassie Blue R-250 e descoloradas. As bandas serão cortadas em pedaços com cerca de 1x1 mm e transferidas para um tubo de microcentrífuga. Os pedaços de géis serão lavados com tampão de descoloração (25 mM de bicarbonato de amônio, etanol 50%) por 20 min ou até que a coloração fosse completamente removida. Os pedaços de géis desidratados em etanol 100% por 10 min a 25ºC até que fiquem endurecidos e esbranquiçados. Os pedaços de géis serão secos em speedvac por 5 minutos. Em seguida, as proteínas serão reduzidas (10 mM de DTT em 50 mM de bicarbonato de amônio) e alquiladas (55 mM de iodoacetamida em 50 mM de bicarbonato de amônio). Os pedaços de géis passarão por dois ciclos de hidratação (50 mM bicarbonato de amônio) e desidratação (etanol 100%). Por fim, os pedaços de géis serão secos e reidratados em solução de tripsina (12.5 ng/μL em 50 mM de bicarbonato de amônio) por 20 minutos a 4ºC. O excesso de tripsina será removido e os pedaços de gel incubados por 15 horas (overnight) com tampão de digestão. Para interromper a digestão será utilizado ácido trifluoroacético (TFA) 100% para acidificar a amostra. Logo após, os peptídeos da matriz do gel serão extraídos duas vezes utilizando tampão de extração (TFA 3% e acetonitrila (ACN) 30%) por 10 minutos a 25ºC. As amostras serão passadas duas vezes em stage tip e lavadas com ACN 5% e 0,1% de TFA. Em seguida os peptídeos eluídos lentamente em 80% de ACN e 0,1% de TFA serão analisados no espectrômetro de massas. Do volume total eluído do stage tip, 10 μl (3.3 μg) de amostra serão injetados no cromatógrafo. A separação dos peptídeos será feita com gradiente linear de 120 min com 5 a 40% de ACN em coluna analítica de 15 cm de comprimento, 75 μm de diâmetro e partículas de C18 de 3 μm. Os peptídeos serão ionizados por nano eletro spray (voltagem de 2,3 kV) e injetados no espectrômetro de massas LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD (Thermo Scientific) da Plataforma de Espectrometria de Massas do Instituto Carlos Chagas, Fiocruz-PR.
Os arquivos gerados (com extensão RAW) serão analisados na plataforma MaxQuant versão 1.5.2.8, a qual inclui o algoritmo Andromeda para a busca de dados. Os parâmetros usados serão maximum miss-cleavage sites =2; maximum charge state = 7; enzima tripsina/P. As identidades das proteínas serão determinadas contra um banco de dados decoy, o qual será preparado invertendo-se a sequência de cada entrada do banco de dados utilizado e anexando-as as sequências. A busca será conduzida contra uma sequência proteica humana contendo mais de 70 mil entradas a partir do banco de dados Uniprot. Para a validação das proteínas identificadas, um mínimo de sete aminoácidos por peptídeo será requerido. Além disso, um false discovery rate (FDR) de 0.01 será aplicado tanto em nível de peptídeo como de proteína. A quantificação proteica será realizada utilizando-se uma abordagem label free, em que os peptídeos eluídos de cada corrida são detectados como características tridimensionais – tempo de retensão versus intensidade do sinal (cromatograma de íons extraídos) versus relação massa/carga, a qual é comparada entre as corridas. 

3.2 ESTUDO IN VIVO - TRANSPLANTE DE VEs 
3.2.4 ADMINISTRAÇÃO E RASTREAMENTO POR IMAGEM DE FLUORESCÊNCIA IN VIVO DE VEs
 A administração de VEs será pela veia da cauda (30 ug de VEs em 200 μl de solução salina). Os camundongos irão receber as VEs ressuspensas em solução salina 0,9%, injetadas intravenosamente a uma concentração de 80 µg por 2 ml (Teng et al., 2015). Para avaliar a migração das VEs in vivo, parte dos animais receberá a administração de VEs previamente marcadas com o fluróforo PKH26. Serão obtidas imagens de fluorescência in vivo utilizando um instrumento de imagem óptica multiespectral (MS FX Pro Bruker)(Azambuja et al 2020). Imagens de corpo inteiro dos animais serão adquiridas imediatamente após a administração, bem como decorridas 4 horas, 24 horas e 7 dias após a injeção de VEs. A análise das imagens permitirá avaliar in vivo e obter uma estimativa semi-quantitativa da migração e acúmulo das VEs em órgãos como baço, fígado, pulmões e medula espinhal. 

3.2.5 DESFECHO 
A partir dos 115 dias de vida os animais serão observados diariamente quanto aos sinais de paralisia. O desfecho será determinado pela idade que o camundongo for incapaz de voltar à posição normal em 30 segundos quando colocado deitado sobre as costas, na posição supina, quando serão eutanasiados por um experimentador cego ao grupo de tratamento. Além disso, os animais serão avaliados e pesados continuamente para acompanhamento do aparecimento de sintomas. As avaliações se darão semanalmente até a 9a. semana, duas vezes por semana a partir da 11a. semana  de vida, se três vezes quando atingirem a 16a. semana até o desfecho (Venturin et al 2016). Todas as avaliações serão realizadas entre 13h00 e 16h00. Será considerado que os animais atingiram o estágio sintomático quando perderem 10% do seu peso máximo. 
3.2.6 FUNÇÃO MOTORA
O acompanhamento da função motora será realizado semanalmente  a partir da 11a. semana até o desfecho. Será utilizado o teste do Rotarod (EFF 412, Insight, Brasil), conforme previamente descrito (Venturin et al, 2016). Brevemente, os animais serão colocados na posição oposta à rotação e deverão permanecer no cilindro por 7 minutos com rotação de 16 rpm. Será avaliada a latência até a queda do animal. 
Os camundongos também terão sua função neuromuscular avaliada através de eletromiografia (EMG). Esta será realizada com eletrodo de agulha concêntrica descartável com 0,35mm de diâmetro e 0,07mm de área de registro que permitirá detectar sinais de desnervação e registrar os fenômenos de reinervação, pela análise do recrutamento motor e das características das unidades motoras. Serão avaliados qualitativamente a presença de atividade espontânea e recrutamento reduzido em músculo do membro inferior, superior e masseter. O exame será  realizado em um eletromiógrafo Viasys Synergy.
Extração de RNA e síntese de cDNA
Será realizada extração de RNA da medula espinhal dos animais dos diferentes grupos e dos astrócitos expostos às VEs. Será  utiliza o kit RNA SV-Total (Promega). As amostras serão expostas a um tampão de lise, aquecidas a 70° por 3 minutos e centrifugadas a 12000 g por 10 minutos a 4°C. O sobrenadante será coletado e adicionado e ele 200 µL de álcool 95%. O conteúdo será transferido para uma coluna de sílica e centrifugado a 12000 g por 1 minuto. Será adicionado 600 µL de tampão e novamente centrifugado a 12000 g por 1 minuto onde será adicionado enzima DNAse diluída em tampão e cloreto de manganês (MgCl2) e incubado por 15 minutos a temperatura ambiente. Será adicionado tampão de bloqueio da enzima e as colunas foram novamente centrifugadas a 12000 g por 1 minuto. As colunas serão lavadas com tampão de lavagem e o RNA retido na sílica foi eluído com 100 µL de água livre de RNAse através de centrifugação a 12000 g por 2 minutos. 
A síntese de DNA complementar (cDNA) será realizada utilizando GoScript™ Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) conforme orientação do fabricante. Será adicionado 16 μL de RNA em 4 μL da master mix GoScript, os quais serão expostos aos seguintes ciclos térmicos: 25°C por 10 minutos, 42°C por 60 minutos e 85°C por 5 minutos; utilizando termociclador Veriti (Applied Biosystems). O DNA complementar ao RNA extraído será quantificado utilizando o NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) conforme orientação do fabricante.
ANÁLISE MOLECULAR ATRAVÉS DE qRT-PCR
A análise da expressão gênica será realizada através da reação em cadeia de polimerase em tempo real (RT-PCR) utilizando equipamento StepOne Plus (Life Techologies, Califórnia, EUA). Serão realizadas amplificações a partir de 20 ng de cDNA para cada amostra. Os ensaios serão realizados em placas individuais para cada gene utilizando o gene colocar o nome por extenso (GAPDH) como controle endógeno de expressão. Serão utilizados primers complementares a sequência dos RNAs relacionados aos seguintes genes: SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, PGC-1α, VDAC,  IRE1, PERK e ATF6. Para análise da expressão relativa dos  genes através de qRT-PCR será utilizado o método de quantificação relativa através do cálculo de 2-ΔΔct utilizando teste t de Student (software SPSS, Inc.) para obter análise estatística dos dados.
3.2.7.2 IMUNO-HISTOQUÍMICA DA MEDULA ESPINHAL 
Grupos adicionais, cada um deles constituídos de 5 animais, serão perfundidos transcardiamente com solução salina seguida de paraformaldeído 4% (PFA) aos 120 dias de vida para análise histológica (Venturin et al 2016). Serão obtidos cortes seriados por congelação da  medula espinhal.  A co-localização de DAPI com ChAT (Acetilcolina transferase) será detectada em um microscópio confocal (LSM 5 Exciter, Carl Zeiss, Alemanha), e o número de motoneurônios ChAT+ será quantificado para determinar avaliar o efeito da administração das VEs na degeneração neuronal associada ao modelo. Também serão avaliados cortes com imunocoloração com anticorpo para astrócitos através da proteína glial fibrilar ácida (anti-GFAP; 1: 400, Chemicon International); Após a incubação com os anticorpos primários, as seções serão lavadas em PBS e incubadas em temperatura ambiente por 1 hora com anticorpos secundários conjugados com Alexa Fluor 488 (1: 1000, Invitrogen). 
3.2.7.3 ANÁLISE DAS CITOCINAS  PRO E ANTI- INFLAMATÓRIAS
Para determinar os níveis de citocinas, o tecido e o soro serão coletados dos camundongos e homogeneizados em solução salina tamponada com fosfato (PBS). Th1 / Th2 citocinas: GM-CSF,, IFN gama], IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL -6, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-18, TNF alfa  serão medidas simultaneamente usando um ProcartaPlex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, EUA). As citocinas serão dosadas por MagPix (MILLIPLEXR, Millipore, Alemanha) e os resultados analisados ​​por meio do software xPONENTR 4.2 (MILLIPLEXR, Millipore, Alemanha). 
3.2.8 Análises de homeostase energética, redox e estresse de retículo endoplasmático
3.2.8.2 Determinação de espécies reativas de oxigênio (ERO)
As espécies reativas serão acessadas através da oxidação de 2′-7′-diclorofluoresceína diacetato (DCFH-DA). A amostra será incubada a 37°, no escuro, durante 1 hora, juntamente com DCFH diacetato (DCFH-DA), o qual será clivado pelas esterases celulares e irá formar DCFH, o qual será oxidado pelas espécies reativas presentes na amostra, gerando um composto fluorescente, DCF. A oxidação de DCFH será medida fluorimetricamente, nos comprimentos de onda de 488nm e 525 nm, como excitação e emissão, respectivamente. Será utilizada uma curva padrão de DCF e os resultados serão expressos como μmol/mg proteína (LeBel et al, 1992).
3.2.8.3 Medida de capacidade antioxidante total
A capacidade antioxidante total será mensurada através da utilização de um kit de colorimetria (Total Antioxidant Capacity Assay Kit), da empresa Abcam, de acordo com as instruções do fabricante. O resultado será expresso em μmol/mg de proteína.

We reserve the right to contact the affiliated institutions of authors who have not acted according to good research and publication practices.
1.4.1. Plagiarism and Duplication
Frontiers checks all submitted manuscripts for plagiarism and duplication, and publishes only original content. Those manuscripts where plagiarism or duplication is shown to have occurred will not be considered for publication in a Frontiers journal. It is required that all submissions consist of content that has not been published previously. In accordance with COPE guidelines, we expect that “original wording taken directly from publications by other researchers should appear in quotation marks with the appropriate citations.” This condition also applies to an author’s own work.
1.4.2. Theses and Dissertations
Frontiers allows the inclusion of content which first appeared in an author’s thesis so long as this is the only form in which it has appeared, is in line with the author’s university policy, and can be accessed online. If the thesis is not archived online, it is considered original, unpublished data and is subject to the unpublished data restrictions of some article types. Inclusion of material from theses or dissertations should be noted in the Acknowledgements section of the manuscript AND cited accordingly in the reference list. For some examples, please check our Manuscript Formatting Guidelines.
1.4.3. Conferences, Proceedings, and Abstracts
Manuscripts that first appeared as conference papers must be expanded upon if they are to be considered as original work. Authors are required to add a substantial amount of original content in the form of new raw material (experiments, data) or new treatment of old data sets which lead to original discussion and/or conclusions, providing value that significantly exceeds the original conference version. As a rule of thumb, at least 30% of the content must be original. Authors submitting such work are required to:
seek permission for reuse of the published conference paper if the author does not hold the copyright (proof of permission should be submitted as supplementary material or sent to editorial.office@frontiersin.org with the manuscript ID upon submission);
cite the conference in the Acknowledgements section, or the references section if applicable.
1.4.4. Blogs
Although permissible, extended manuscript content which previously appeared online in non-academic media, e.g. blogs, should be declared at the time of submission in the acknowledgements section of the manuscript.
1.4.5. Preprints
Frontiers’ supportive preprint policy encourages full open access at all stages of a research paper, to share and generate knowledge researchers need to support their work. Authors publishing in Frontiers journals may share their work ahead of submission to a peer-reviewed journal, as well as during the Frontiers review process, on repositories or preprint servers (such as arXiv, PeerJ Preprints, OSF, and others), provided that the server imposes no restrictions upon the author's full copyright and re-use rights. Also note that any manuscript files shared after submission to Frontiers journals, during the review process, cannot contain the Frontiers logo or branding.
Correct attribution of the original source in repositories or preprint servers must be included within the manuscript on submission or added at re-submission if the deposition is done during the review process. We ask that the preprint is both listed within the acknowledgement section and the full citation included in the reference list.
If the article is published, authors are then strongly encouraged to link from the preprint server to the Frontiers publication to enable readers to find, access, and cite the final peer-reviewed version. Please note that we cannot consider for publication content that has been previously published, or is already under review, within a scientific journal, book or similar entity.
1.4.6. Translations
Frontiers accepts manuscript submissions that are exact translations of previously published work. This should be clearly stated in the manuscript upon submission. Permission from the original publisher and authors needs to be sought and stated in the manuscript. Relevant documents should be provided as supplementary material for verification by the editor and the editorial office. The original work from which the manuscript has been translated should be clearly referenced.
&quot;This is a (‘language’) language translation/reprint of (‘insert title here’) originally published in (‘insert name here’). (‘Insert name here’) prepared this translation with support from (insert name of funding source, if any). Permission was granted by (‘insert name here’)”.
Please note that Frontiers may request copies of related publications if there are any concerns about overlap or possible redundancy.
1.5. Corrections
Frontiers recognizes our responsibility to correct scientifically relevant errors in previously published articles. Corrections can be submitted if:
a small portion of an otherwise reliable publication proves to be misleading; OR
there is an error in a figure that does not alter the conclusions; OR
there is an error in statistical data not altering conclusions; OR
there are mislabeled figures; OR
the wrong slide of microscopy was provided; OR
if the author / contributor list is incorrect when a deserving author has been omitted or somebody who does not meet authorship criteria has been included.
A correction must be submitted through our submission system (check this link for detailed instructions on how to submit a correction), and it is advised to use the following Word and LaTeX templates. The contribution to the field statement should be used to clearly state the reason for the correction and the title of the submission should have the following format: &quot;Corrigendum: Title of original article&quot;.
If the error was introduced during the publishing process, the Frontiers Production Office should be contacted.
1.6. Retractions
As a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), Frontiers abides by their guidelines and recommendations in cases of potential retraction.
Frontiers also abides by two other key principles, as recommended by COPE:
retractions are not about punishing authors;
retraction statements should be public and linked to the original, retracted article.
All potential retractions will be judged on their own merits and will be the subject of an internal investigation or, where satisfactory, the recommendations from the institutional investigation of the author(s). Frontiers considers the following reasons as giving cause for concern and potential retraction:
clear evidence that findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error);
findings have previously been published elsewhere without proper attribution, permission or justification (i.e. cases of redundant publication);
major plagiarism;
the reporting of unethical research, the publication of an article that did not have the required ethics committee approval;
legal issues pertaining to the content of the article, e.g. libelous content;
major authorship issues, i.e. proven or strongly suspected cases of ghostwriting or sold (‘gift’) authorship;
politically motivated articles where objectivity is a serious concern;
the singling out of individuals or organizations for attack;
faith issues (e.g. intelligent design);
papers that have made extraordinary claims without concomitant scientific or statistical evidence (e.g. pseudoscience).
Readers who would like to draw the editors' attention to published work that might require retraction should contact the authors of the article and write to the journal, making sure to include copies of all correspondence with authors.
Please find more details on our comments and complaints policy here.
1.7. Ethical Concerns
For any ethical concerns, please contact us at editorial.office@frontiersin.org.
2. Editorial Policies
2.1. Conflicts of Interest
A conflict of interest can be anything potentially interfering with, or that could be perceived as interfering with, full and objective peer review, decision-making or publication of articles submitted to Frontiers. Personal, financial, and professional affiliations or relationships can be perceived as conflicts of interest.
All authors and members of Frontiers Editorial Boards are required to disclose any actual and potential conflicts of interest at submission or upon accepting an editorial or review assignment.
The Frontiers review system is designed to guarantee the most transparent and objective editorial and review process, and because the handling editor’s and reviewers' names are made public upon the publication of articles, conflicts of interest will be widely apparent.
Failure to declare competing interests can result in the rejection of a manuscript. If an undisclosed competing interest comes to light after publication, Frontiers will take action in accordance with internal policies and Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines.
Anything that can be perceived as a potential conflict of interest should be disclosed within the statements section, during submission. A conflict of interest statement will be automatically generated, included in the generated PDF file for peer review, and in the final publication version of the article.
2.1.1. What Should I Disclose?
As an author, disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest should be done during the submission process. Consider the following questions and make sure you disclose any positive answers:
Did you or your institution at any time receive payment or services from a third party for any aspect of the submitted work?
Do you have financial relationships (such as commercial affiliation/employment, funding, intellectual property, etc.) with entities that could be perceived to influence, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what you wrote in the submitted work?
Do you have any patents and/or copyrights, whether pending, issued, licensed, and/or receiving royalties related to the research?
Do you have other relationships or activities that readers could perceive to have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what you wrote in the submitted work?
If you failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest during submission, or in case of doubt, please contact the Frontiers Editorial Office at editorial.office@frontiersin.org with the details of the potential conflicts as soon as possible.
For commercial affiliations, all authors must be accounted for. We recommend using the following template:
“Author XXXXXXX was employed by the company XXXXXXX.The remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest”.
For commercial funding, the role of the funder must be declared. We recommend the following statements:
“The authors declare that this study received funding from XXXXXXX. The funder had the following involvement with the study: XXXXXXX”.
“The authors declare that this study received funding from XXXXXXX. The funder was not involved in the study design, collection, analysis, interpretation of data, the writing of this article or the decision to submit it for publication”.
2.1.2. What About Editors and Reviewers?
Handling editors and reviewers will be asked to consider the following potential conflicts of interest before accepting any editing or review assignment:

FAMILY
1. Are any of the authors a spouse or significant other, a member of the same family or a very close personal friend? Review Editors should also not be a member of the same family as the handling editor.
COLLABORATIONS
2. Are you currently hosting or have hosted a Frontiers Research Topic with any of the authors within the past 2 years?
3. Are you currently collaborating or have you collaborated on a research project or a publication with any of the authors within the past 2 years?
4. Are you currently collaborating or have you collaborated with any of the authors as an advisor or in any other direct supervisory capacity in the past five years?
5. Are you currently collaborating or have you collaborated with any of the authors as a student or in any other direct subordinate capacity in the past five years?
Note: Review Editors should not accept assignments if they have a close professional relationship with the handling editor, which in their view could affect the objectivity of the review.
AFFILIATION
6. Are you affiliated with the same institution as any of the authors? If so, has this resulted in interactions, collaborations or mutual interests with the authors that would compromise your impartiality in conducting this review?
7. Are you a current member of a committee or department that coincides with an affiliation with any of the authors?
FINANCIAL
8. Do you have a business or professional partnership with any author?
9. Do you have financial interests or business relations with any organization involved in this research or in the preparation of the manuscript?
10. Do you have any financial interest or competing interests in the content of the manuscript that might affect your ability to perform an objective review?

2.2. Funding Disclosure
Details of all funding sources must be provided in the funding section of the manuscript, including grant numbers, if applicable. All Frontiers articles are published with open access under the CC-BY Creative Commons attribution license. Articles published with Frontiers automatically fulfil or exceed the requirements for open access mandated by many institutions and funding bodies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council, Research Councils UK, and the Wellcome Trust. Frontiers submits funding data to the Open Funder Registry, which is a funder identification service from CrossRef resulting from collaboration between scholarly publishers and funding agencies.
2.2.1. Disclaimer
Any necessary disclaimers which must be included in the published article should be clearly indicated in the manuscript.
2.3. Bioethics
All research submitted to Frontiers for consideration must have been conducted in accordance with Frontiers guidelines on study ethics. In accordance with COPE guidelines, Frontiers reserves the right to reject any manuscript that editors believe does not uphold high ethical standards, even if authors have obtained ethical approval or if ethical approval is not required. Frontiers encourages authors to follow the ARRIVE guidelines for the design, analysis, and reporting of scientific research.
2.3.1. Studies Involving Animal Subjects
All research involving regulated animals (i.e. all live vertebrates and higher invertebrates) must have been reviewed and approved by an ethics committee prior to commencing the study and performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations. Frontiers follows the International Association of Veterinary Editors guidelines for publication of studies including animal research. Clinical studies involving animals and interventions outside of routine care require ethics committee oversight as per the American Veterinary Medical Association. Authors must provide ethics approval information within the submission system, which generates an ethics statement to be included in the submission. The generated ethics statement will be included in the reviewer file, in the following format:
“The animal study was reviewed and approved by [Full name and affiliation of ethics committee]”.
Should the study be exempt from ethics approval, authors need to state the reasons for exemption within the generated statement. Studies involving client-owned animals (non-commercially available animals, e.g. pets or livestock) should demonstrate the best practice veterinary care and confirm that written informed consent has been granted by the owner(s), or the legal representative of the owner(s). An example of a generated statement for a study involving client owned animals can be found below:
“The animal study was reviewed and approved by [Full name and affiliation of ethics committee]. Written informed consent was obtained from the owners for the participation of their animals in this study”.
2.3.1.1. Humane Endpoints
All manuscripts describing studies where death is an endpoint will be subject to additional ethical considerations. Frontiers reserves the right to reject manuscripts lacking appropriate justification.
2.3.2. Studies Involving Human Subjects
Research involving human subjects should have been conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Studies involving human participants must be performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines, with the appropriate institutional ethics committee's prior approval and informed written consent from all human subjects involved in the study including for publication of the results. Confirmation of this approval is required upon submission of a manuscript to Frontiers; authors must provide ethics committee information within the submission system, which generates an ethics statement to be included in the submission. Information regarding subjects’ (or when appropriate, the parent’s or guardian’s) consent for participation should be provided within the submission system. Frontiers requires that consent for participation is both informed and written, unless waived by an ethics committee or otherwise not required as per local legislation. The submission system will generate an ethics statement in the following format (the statement will also be included in the final manuscript version for publication):
“The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by [Full name and affiliation of ethics committee]. The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study”.
Should the study be exempt from ethics approval or consent procedures, authors need to clearly state the reasons in the generated statement. Frontiers may request a letter from the authors, obtained from an ethics committee in cases where full review and approval has been waived by the committee.
In order to protect subject anonymity, identifying information should not be included in the manuscript unless such information is absolutely necessary for scientific purposes AND explicit approval has been granted by the subjects.
2.3.3. Inclusion of Identifiable Human Data
Frontiers follows the ICMJE recommendations on the protection of research participants, which state that patients have a right to privacy that should not be violated without informed consent. We require nonessential identifiable details to be omitted from all manuscripts, and written informed consent will be required if there is any doubt that anonymity can be maintained.
It is the responsibility of the researchers and authors to ensure that these principles are complied with, including the obtaining of written informed consent for publication of any potentially identifiable data or images.
Written informed consent can be documented on a form provided by an institution or ethics committee, and it must clearly state how the identifiable data will be used. Frontiers makes available its own form, which may be used for this purpose, although not required if an alternative form of consent, meeting the ICMJE recommendations, is used. We consider it to be the author's duty to encourage participants or patients whose consent for publication is required to read and understand the ICMJE guidelines, for their information prior to completing the consent form. Participants should also be encouraged to ask any questions and to ensure they are comfortable before they sign the consent form.
The completed consent forms should be stored by authors or their respective institutions, in accordance with institutional policies. Completed forms should not be included with your Frontiers submission. However, consent forms should be made available upon request from the editor or editorial office, during the review process or post-publication.
The determination of what constitutes identifiable data lies with our editors and editorial office staff, and manuscripts may be rejected if the required consent documents cannot be provided. Please note that written informed consent for publication is required for all case report articles where the patient or subject is identified or identifiable. Information regarding participant/patient consent for publication of identifiable data should be provided within the submission system. This will generate an ethics statement that will be directly included in the manuscript.
2.3.4. Clinical Trials
The World Health Organization defines a clinical trial as &quot;any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes&quot;. In accordance with the Clinical Trial Registration Statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMEJ), all clinical trials must be registered in a public trials registry at or before the onset of participant enrolment. To meet the requirements of the ICMJE and Frontiers, clinical trials can be registered with any Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry.
Clinical trial reports should be compliant with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) by including a flow diagram presenting the enrolment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and data analysis with number of subjects for each and taking into account the CONSORT Checklist of items to include when reporting a randomized clinical trial.
The information on the clinical trial registration (Unique Identifier and URL) must be included in the abstract.
2.4. Materials and Data Policies
Frontiers is committed to open science and open data; we require that authors make available all data relevant to the conclusions of the manuscript. Generated data should be publicly available and cited in accordance with our Data Citation Guidelines. We aim to achieve the best community standards regarding data availability, ensuring increased levels of transparency and reproducibility in our published articles.
Our policies on data availability are informed by community-driven standards, which Frontiers endorses, such as the Transparency and Openness (TOP) guidelines, and the joint declaration of data citation principles produced by FORCE 11.
2.4.1. Availability of Materials
Authors are required to make all materials used to conduct their research available to other researchers. Research materials necessary to enable the reproduction of an experiment should be clearly indicated in the Materials and Methods section. Relevant materials such as protocols, analytic methods, and study material should preferably be uploaded to an online repository providing a global persistent link/identifier. If this is not possible, authors are strongly encouraged to make this material available upon request to interested researchers, and this should be stated in the manuscript.
2.4.1.1. Resource Identification Initiative
Authors wishing to participate in the Resource Identification Initiative should cite antibodies, genetically modified organisms, software tools, data, databases, and services using the corresponding catalog number and RRID in your current manuscript. For more information about the project and for steps on how to search for an RRID, please click here.
2.4.2. Availability of Data
Frontiers requires that authors make the “minimal data set” underlying the findings described and used to reach the conclusions of the manuscript, available to any qualified researchers. The data should be FAIR—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—so that other researchers can locate and use the data. However, exceptions are granted if data cannot be made publicly available for legal or ethical reasons.
To comply with best practice in their field of research, authors are required to make certain types of data available to readers at the time of publication in specific, stable, community-supported repositories such as those listed below. Authors are encouraged to contact our data availability office at datapolicy@frontiersin.org prior to submission with any queries concerning data reporting.
2.4.2.1. Exceptions Related to Availability of Data
We strongly encourage sharing the maximal amount of data; however where ethical, legal or privacy issues are present the data should not be shared. In cases where some or all data cannot be shared for legal, ethical or privacy restrictions, the authors should make these limitations clear in the Data Availability Statement at the time of submission.
Possible limitations to making data publicly available include patient confidentiality and participant privacy. Authors should ensure that the data shared are in accordance with the ethical consent provided by participants on the use of confidential/identifiable human data. We require that the authors demonstrate that publication of such data does not compromise the anonymity of the participants or breach local data protection laws.
In situations where access is restricted to protect confidential or proprietary information, authors are required to explain the restrictions on the dataset and make the data available upon request with permission of the third party. The Data Availability Statement should include all necessary contact information to request access to the dataset.
2.4.3. Data Citation Guidelines
Authors are encouraged to cite all datasets generated or analyzed in the study. Where datasets are cited, they should be included in the references list to maximize future usability. The following format should be used:
[Dataset] Author names. (year) Data Title. Repository name. Version. Persistent identifier
2.4.4. Data Availability Statements
Data availability statements are required for all articles published with Frontiers. During the submission process, authors will be asked to detail the location of the raw data underlying the conclusions made in the manuscript, and whether it will be made available to other researchers following publication. Authors will also be asked for the details of any existing datasets that have been analysed in the manuscript. These datasets should be cited in accordance with our data citation guidelines.
A statement will be automatically generated using the information provided in the submission form; however, manuscripts containing incomplete or incorrect statements will be prevented from entering the review process.

2.4.7. Inclusion of RNAseq Data
Studies employing RNASeq for comparative transcriptomic analyses must contain at least three biological replicates (unless otherwise justified). Each biological replicate should be represented in an independent library, each with a unique barcode if libraries are multiplexed for sequencing. Validation on a number of key transcripts highlighted in the study is also highly recommended.
Full data accompanying these experiments must be made available to reviewers at the time of submission in a freely accessible resource, e.g the sequence read archive (SRA) or European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). Depending on the question addressed in a manuscript, de novo assemblies of transcriptomes may also require multiple replicates, and assembled sequences together with sequence annotation must be made freely available, e.g figshare or dryad.
2.4.8. Inclusion of Proteomics Data
Authors should provide relevant information relating to how peptide/protein matches were undertaken, including methods used to process and analyze data, false discovery rates (FDR) for large-scale studies, and threshold or cut-off rates for peptide and protein matches. Further information should include software used, mass spectrometer type, sequence database and version, number of sequences in database, processing methods, mass tolerances used for matching, variable/fixed modifications, allowable missed cleavages, etc.
Authors should provide as supplementary material the information used to identify proteins and/or peptides. This should include information such as accession numbers, observed mass (m/z), charge, delta mass, matched mass, peptide/protein scores, peptide modification, miscleavages, peptide sequence, match rank, matched species (for cross-species matching), number of peptide matches, etc. Ambiguous protein/peptide matches should be indicated.
For quantitative proteomics analyses, authors should provide information to justify the statistical significance, including biological replicates, statistical methods, estimates of uncertainty, and the methods used for calculating error.
For peptide matches with biologically relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs) and for any protein match that has occurred using a single mass spectrum, authors should include this information as raw data or annotated spectra, or submit data to an online repository (recommended option; see table below).
Raw or matched data and 2-DE images should be submitted to public proteomics repositories such as those participating in ProteomeXchange. Submission codes and/or links to data should be provided within the manuscript.
2.4.9. Code
Frontiers is committed to open science and open data; we require that authors make available all code used to conduct their research available to other researchers. Code necessary to enable the reproduction of an experiment should be clearly indicated in the Materials and Methods section, and where possible code should be uploaded to an online repository (such as github.com or code ocean) providing a global persistent link/identifier.
Our policies on code availability are informed by community-driven standards, which Frontiers endorses, such as the Transparency and Openness (TOP) guidelines, and the joint declaration of data citation principles produced by FORCE 11.
2.4.9.1 Exceptions Related to Code Availability
We strongly encourage sharing original code where possible. In situations where custom code is proprietary, an exception will be granted providing that all relevant software needed to replicate the results of the study are available commercially for researchers. Details of the proprietary software used should be listed in the materials and methods section.
At submission, authors should declare any intellectual property relating to the code and themselves in a conflict of interest statement.
2.5. Statistics
Frontiers requires that all statements concerning quantitative differences should be based on quantitative data and statistical testing. For example, if a quantitative statement is made regarding the abundance of a certain protein based on a western blot, we request that the blot be scanned and the abundance assessed quantitatively using the correct analytic software (e.g. ImageJ) and statistics in order to support that statement.
Statistics should/must be applied for independent experiments. The number of independent samples and the deviation parameters (e.g. standard error of the mean, standard deviation, confidence intervals) should be clearly stated in the Methods or the Figure legends. In general, technical replicates within a single experiment are not considered to be independent samples. Where multiple comparisons are employed (e.g. microarray data or genome-wide association studies), any analysis should correct for false positive results. Descriptions of statistical procedures should include the software and analysis used, and must be sufficiently detailed to be reproduced.
2.5.1. Experiments
Authors are required to specifically state in their legends how many times experiments were performed (in general we require n=3 as a minimum) and what specific statistical analysis was performed.
2.6. Image Manipulation
Frontiers takes concerns regarding image manipulation seriously. We request that no individual features within an image are modified (eg. enhanced, obscured, moved, recycled, removed or added). Image processing methods (e.g. changes to the brightness, contrast or color balance) must be applied to every pixel in the image and the changes should not alter the information illustrated in the figure. Where cropped images of blots are shown in figures, a full scan of the entire original gel(s) must be submitted as part of the supplementary material. Where control images are re-used for illustrative purposes, this must be clearly declared in the figure legend. If any form of image processing is legitimately required for the interpretation of the data, the software and the enhancement technique must be declared in the methods section of the manuscript. Image grouping and splicing must be clearly stated in the manuscript and the figure text. Any concerns raised over undeclared image modifications will be investigated and the authors will be asked to provide the original images.
2.7. Support
In our commitment to continuously improve our user experience and support to the research communities, we welcome your feedback, questions and suggestions. Please visit our Help Center to find guidance on our platform or contact us at support@frontiersin.org.</Text>

• All copy must be double-spaced, including text, footnotes, references, figure legends, and tables. 
• Each manuscript page must be numbered clearly, with the numbering continuing throughout.
• Before starting writing your manuscript check the author guidelines of your target journal !
• Replace text between brackets with your information
• Once finished, choose File-Compile (⌥⌘E) and select all the text  you want to export (under All Options-Compile): 
	- for submission review in MS Word or in another word processor to make sure that everything complies with your requirements!) or 
	- for placement in page layout software (such as inDesign) for dissertations or thesis with multiple tables or figures.
• Before submitting your manuscript, use a plagiarism checking tool!Some journals even require the authors to submit a report form one of those tools, and all academic papers such as thesis and dissertations are examined by these tools.</Text>
