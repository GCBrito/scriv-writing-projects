• Some journals require a “product sources” page (at the end of the paper) that lists (in alphabetical order), for each device or supply used in the study, the name/model, manufacturer, and city and state of the manufacturer. 
Conversely, some journals state that information parenthetically at first mention of each device or supply. (Respir Care 2004 (49) 10 1222-1228)
