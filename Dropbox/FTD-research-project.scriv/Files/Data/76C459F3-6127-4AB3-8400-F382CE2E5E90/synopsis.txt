Identify a lack of knowledge or gap in understanding.  After you sketch that research, tell readers what part of it you will extend, modify, or correct.  Restate the question as something that the research has gotten wrong, explained poorly, or failed to consider.  

This section addresses the ‘so what’ question.  What larger issue will readers not understand if the research question is not answered?
