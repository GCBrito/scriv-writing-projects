The landscape of the frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders. About 70% is sporadic with approximately equal numbers of TDP-43 proteinopathies and tauopathies (including corticoba- sal degeneration, CBD progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP Pickâ€™s disease, GGT globular glial tauopathy), and a smaller number of FUSopathies (including atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions, aFTLDU). About 30% is genetic with TDP- 43 proteinopathies being the commonest cause (mutations in C9orf72 (usually TDP-43 types A or B), GRN (type A), TBK1 (types A or B), VCP (type D), SQSTM1, and TARDBP) then tauopathies (mutations in MAPT), FUSopathies (mu other proteinopa- thies (mutations in CHMP2B)
